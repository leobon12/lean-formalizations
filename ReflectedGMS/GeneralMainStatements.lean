# Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 of the general-cell singular-set manuscript — statements

Manuscript text: `work/general/manuscript-text.txt`, lines 141–231.

**Hypotheses.**
* The environment law `P` is carried by codes satisfying **Definition 1.1 and (LCS)** with canonical
  labels (`GeneralLaws.SupportedOnValidGeneral`, built on `Code.ValidGeneral` and
  `GeneralGeometry`): compact connected cells with nonempty interiors meeting pairwise in null sets,
  a closed `H¹`-null singular set off which the cells cover and are spatially locally finite,
  arbitrary symmetric adjacency with intersecting adjacent cells and finite positive conductances,
  and connectivity of `H(L)` for every axis-parallel compact segment `L` avoiding the singular set.
  No face/incidence rule, no exceptional vertex set, no assumed graph connectedness and no
  almost-everywhere line connectivity.
* Mass transport modulo scaling (1.4), the moment (FE) with the conductance sums read as extended
  nonnegative sums, and for Theorem 1.3 ergodicity modulo scaling — `GeneralLaws.MassTransport`,
  `GeneralLaws.FiniteEnergyMoment`, `GeneralLaws.EnvironmentErgodic`, on the general environment
  space `Code.EnvGeneral`.

`GeneralHarmonicCoordinateMainTheorem` and `GeneralReflectedInvarianceMainTheorem` carry exactly
these hypotheses; **graph local finiteness is not assumed** — it is derived (Lemma 2.5,
`GeneralLaws.ae_finiteRows`), and the conclusion records it through `∃ hV : SupportedOnValid P`.

The `…OfLocallyFinite` variants are an intermediate form that assumes graph local finiteness
(`∀ᵐ r ∂P, Code.FiniteRows r`) and states (1.4), (FE) and ergodicity with the earlier predicates
`AmbientMassTransport`, `FiniteEnergyMoment`, `AmbientEnvironmentErgodic` on `validLaw P _`.  They
are proved too, and are implied by the paper-faithful theorems' ingredients; they are kept because
on the GMS class local finiteness is automatic (`GMSGeometry.locallyFiniteGraph`).

**Conclusions.**  Clause-for-clause those of `HarmonicMainStatement.HarmonicCoordinateConclusions`
and `InvarianceMainStatement.ReflectedInvarianceConclusions`, plus the first sentence of 1.3(b):
every graph end has a unique spatial image in `Ssing ∪ {∞}` "as in Proposition 2.6"
(`EndSpatialImageConclusions`).  The end-image sentence is stated **deterministically** for every
environment satisfying Definition 1.1 and (LCS) with a locally finite graph, and for **every**
singular witness, which is stronger than the manuscript's "conditionally on almost every
environment".

/-- **Theorem 1.3(b), first sentence** (Proposition 2.6): for every singular-set witness of
Definition 1.1(ii) and every graph end, the nested spherical closures of the end's cell components
shrink to one point of the Riemann sphere; that point lies in `Ssing ∪ {∞}`; it is `∞` exactly for
the ends at spatial infinity; and the end-to-sphere map is continuous (every open neighbourhood of
the image contains the images of all ends agreeing on a suitable finite vertex set — the basic
neighbourhoods of the end topology).  The image `endImage F e` depends only on the configuration and
the end, not on the witness or an exhaustion. -/

(LCS), (1.4) and (FE) (extended conductance sums), all on the general environment space, with **no**
graph-local-finiteness hypothesis.  The conclusion asserts that almost every environment is valid in
the earlier sense — in particular has a locally finite graph (Lemma 2.5) — and the
harmonic-coordinate conclusions (a)–(d) for the environment law (`(validLaw P hV).map val = P`).
