# Joint measurability of the ordinary-edge bracket integral

`MartingaleIngredients.ordinaryEdgeBracket cells Φ X i j t ω` is the running
Lebesgue integral `∫₀ᵗ Γ(X_s ω) ds` of `p:eq:fastPhibracket`.  The consumer
`PredictableCompletionModification.isStronglyPredictable_ordinaryEdgeBracket_completedNaturalFiltration`
carries exactly one analytic hypothesis, `hjoint : Measurable (uncurry (ordinaryEdgeBracket …))`,
and the trace computation of that module shows the hypothesis cannot be removed:
no completion of the filtration makes an a.e. modification with a wild time
section predictable.  This module discharges `hjoint`.

## The two halves

* **The reduction** (`measurable_uncurry_runningIntegral`,
  `measurable_uncurry_ordinaryEdgeBracket`).  For any *jointly* measurable
  `X : ℝ≥0 → Ω → S` and measurable `g : S → ℝ`, the running interval integral
  `(t, ω) ↦ ∫₀ᵗ g (X s ω) ds` is jointly measurable.  No integrability is
  needed: the Bochner integral of a non-integrable function is `0`, and
  `MeasureTheory.StronglyMeasurable.integral_prod_right'` carries no
  integrability hypothesis either.  Specialised to
  `g = stateBracketDensity cells Φ · i j` with the project idiom
  `measurable_of_countable` for the discrete state type `Option V`.

* **The path** (`measurable_uncurry_process`,
  `measurable_uncurry_exponentialAreaPath`,
  `measurable_uncurry_processFamily_X`).  `ReflectedWalk.ProcessFamily` records
  only the per-time measurability `measurable_X`, and joint measurability is
  *not* a consequence of `IsReflectedWalk`: right continuity there holds only
  almost surely, so on the exceptional null set the path is arbitrary.  For the
  *concrete* process `ReflectedWalk.Existence.process` — the one behind
  `AreaClocks.exponentialAreaPath` and `Existence.processFamily` — joint
  measurability does hold everywhere, and is already implicit in the checked
  fibre computation `ReflectedWalk.PathProperties.measurableSet_prod_process`,
  which exhibits `{(ω, s) | X_s ω = x}` as a product-measurable set.  All that is
  missing is the repackaging, which is what this module supplies.

The end product is `measurable_uncurry_ordinaryEdgeBracket_processFamily`: the
hypothesis `hjoint` of
`isStronglyPredictable_ordinaryEdgeBracket_completedNaturalFiltration`, for the
concrete reflected process family of Theorem 1.6.

Consumer: the third clause of `MartingaleIngredients.HasOrdinaryEdgeBracket`,
i.e. `p:eq:fastPhibracket` of `p:lem:localharm`.

section Reduction

variable {Ω : Type*} [MeasurableSpace Ω]

/-- **The Mathlib-only reduction.**  A running interval integral of a measurable
function of a *jointly* measurable process is jointly measurable in the upper
limit and the sample point.

The proof rewrites the value at `(t, ω)` as a full Lebesgue integral of the
indicator of the product set `{((t, ω), s) | 0 < s ≤ t}`, which is measurable on
`(ℝ≥0 × Ω) × ℝ`, and then applies
`MeasureTheory.StronglyMeasurable.integral_prod_right'` for the (s-finite)
Lebesgue measure on `ℝ`. -/
