/-! Fairness and independence of the first binary digit of a uniform real.

`DyadicGridLaw.map_gridCylinder_gridMeasure` reduces `DyadicApproximation.UniformGridLaw`
for `DyadicGridLaw.gridMeasure` to a statement about the uniform source coordinates:
the relative origins must stay uniform while the parent digits are fair and
independent of them.  The single missing probabilistic input is the one step
identity proved here: under Lebesgue measure on `[0, 1)` the pair

  `x ↦ (Int.fract (2 * x), first binary digit of x)`

is distributed as the product of the uniform law on `[0, 1)` with the fair coin
on `Fin 2`.  Both halves of the statement matter for the consumer: the shifted
fractional part is again exactly uniform on the half-open unit interval, and it
is exactly independent of the digit, not merely uniform in the margin.

The proof is the two affine changes of variable `x ↦ 2 * x` on `[0, 1/2)` and
`x ↦ 2 * x - 1` on `[1/2, 1)`, each of which halves Lebesgue measure, combined
with the dirac decomposition of the fair coin.  The digit is
`DyadicGridLaw.bitInt` read through `DyadicGridLaw.intToFin2`, so no new binary
expansion machinery is introduced. -/
