# The auxiliary **three**-grid marked space

`Spatial/AuxiliaryGridMarkedSpace` builds the two-grid space
`AuxSpace = (goodSet × Grid) × Grid`, whose inner grid is the interpolation grid and whose
**outer** grid is the independent auxiliary dyadic system `𝔻'` of `s:prop:maximal`.  That space
serves `hsub`, `hpatch` and `hconv`, whose consumer projections land in
`MarkedEnvironment = Env × Grid`.

`hcopies` needs one grid more.  Its consumer projection lands in
`GridIndependenceCoupling.CoupledSpace = Env × Grid × Grid` and
`GatedResidualWeakMaximal.copyDifferenceWeakMaximal_of_twoGridSpace` demands
`μ.map proj = ν ⊗ (𝔻 ⊗ 𝔻)`, i.e. **two** independent interpolation grids; and the re-rooting
grid `R.grid` cannot be either of them, because `hprojA` makes both of `proj`'s grid components
`𝒜.sigma`-measurable while `henv.indep` makes `R.grid` independent of `𝒜.sigma` and `henv.law`
forces `μ.map R.grid` to be a `UniformGridLaw`, not a Dirac.  So a genuine third coordinate is
required.

## It is one extra instantiation, not new mathematics

The two-grid construction is uniform in the mark factor, so this file is that construction run
once more with the base space `goodSet × Grid` replaced by `AuxSpace`:

```
TriSpace := AuxSpace × Grid = ((goodSet × Grid) × Grid) × Grid
triLaw ν := (auxLaw ν) ⊗ gridMeasure
```

with the **new auxiliary grid outermost**.  Reading the three grids of a point
`ω = (((e, 𝔻₁), 𝔻₂), 𝔻')`:

* `ω.1.1.2 = 𝔻₁` — the **first** interpolation grid copy;
* `ω.1.2 = 𝔻₂` — the **second** interpolation grid copy;
* `ω.2 = 𝔻'` — the auxiliary dyadic system of the maximal inequality, i.e. `triReRooting.grid`.

Because `triProj ω = (ω.1.1.1, ω.2)` intertwines `env`, `grid` and `shift` *definitionally* with
`GoodMarkedSpace.goodMarked`, `OriginChainRegular`, block equivariance, the measurable block
graph and block scale covariance all transfer by `rfl` from the checked one-grid statements,
exactly as in the two-grid file.

The mass-transport field costs no kernel algebra either: the test function is averaged over the
extra grid `𝔻₂` (`markAverage3`) and the identity is reduced to the already-checked two-grid
`AuxiliaryGridMarkedSpace.lintegral_blockAverageLint_aux` by Tonelli plus the translation and
dilation invariance of the uniform dyadic law.

Nothing here is assumed beyond the manuscript's own hypotheses: `MassTransport ν` and the finite
(FE) moment, through `GoodMarkedSpace.ae_mem_goodSet`.

/-! ### The carrier and the projection -/

/-- **The auxiliary three-grid marked space.**  A point is `(((e, 𝔻₁), 𝔻₂), 𝔻')` with `e` a good
environment, `𝔻₁` and `𝔻₂` the two independent interpolation grid copies and `𝔻'` the auxiliary
dyadic system of the maximal inequality.  The auxiliary grid is the *outermost* factor, so the
inner factor is literally the two-grid space of `Spatial/AuxiliaryGridMarkedSpace`. -/

/-- The projection onto (environment, **auxiliary** grid).  All selected-block data transfers
along it; it is definitionally compatible with `env`, `grid` and `shift`. -/

/-- **The marked re-rooting of the three-grid space.**  The environment is read off the innermost
factor, the dyadic system `𝔻'` is the outermost grid, and re-rooting acts simultaneously on the
two-grid configuration and on the auxiliary grid. -/

`AuxiliaryGridMarkedSpace.lintegral_blockAverageLint_aux` by averaging the test function over the

domain through `triProj`, which intertwines the re-rooting and the dilation, exactly as
`AuxiliaryGridMarkedSpace.invariantDomain_coveredAux` does for the two-grid space.  `coveredTri`
is measurable, conull (Lemma 2.4 under `s:eq:MTP`), left by only a Lebesgue-null set of
re-rootings, and invariant under the dilation action. -/
