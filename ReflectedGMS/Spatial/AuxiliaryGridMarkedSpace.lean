# The auxiliary two-grid marked space

The manuscript's `s:prop:maximal` is applied twice in the corrector lane: once with the
interpolation grid playing the role of the auxiliary dyadic system `𝔻'`, and once with a
*second, independent* dyadic system, because the residual/difference functionals are
themselves functions of the interpolation grid and the single grid of `goodSet × Grid`
cannot play both roles at once.

This module builds that two-grid space:

```
AuxSpace := (goodSet × Grid) × Grid
auxLaw ν := (goodLaw ν) ⊗ gridMeasure
```

with the **auxiliary grid outermost**, so that the first factor is *literally* the existing
good marked space `goodSet × Grid` of `Spatial/GoodMarkedSpace`.  The load-bearing map is

```
proj ω := (ω.1.1, ω.2)   -- (environment, AUXILIARY grid)
```

which intertwines `env`, `grid`, `shift`, and therefore `blockSetAt`, `blockSideAt` and
`originBlockIndex`, **definitionally**.  Consequently `OriginChainRegular` and four of the
five fields of `SimilarityBlockAveraging.SimilarityBlockData` transfer from the checked
one-grid statements by `rfl`, and the whole of `SpatialMaximalInequality.EnvironmentGrid`
is a short rectangle computation, exactly as in `GoodMarkedSpace.indep_goodMarked`.

The remaining field, the mark-averaged mass transport, is supplied in the second half of the
file (`lintegral_blockAverageLint_aux`): it is *derived* from the already-checked one-grid
identity `SpatialMaximalForFiniteEnergy.lintegral_blockAverageLint_eq` by averaging the test
function over the extra grid, so no second copy of the block kernel is needed.

Nothing here is assumed beyond the manuscript's own hypotheses: `MassTransport ν` and the
finite (FE) moment, through `GoodMarkedSpace.ae_mem_goodSet`.

/-! ### The carrier and the projection -/

/-- **The auxiliary two-grid marked space.**  A point is `((e, 𝔻), 𝔻')` with `e` a good
environment, `𝔻` the interpolation grid and `𝔻'` the auxiliary independent dyadic system.
The auxiliary grid is the *outer* factor, so the inner factor is the good marked space. -/
abbrev AuxSpace : Type := (goodSet × Grid) × Grid

/-- The projection onto (environment, **auxiliary** grid).  This is the map along which all
the selected-block data transfers; it is definitionally compatible with `env`, `grid` and
`shift`. -/
def proj (ω : AuxSpace) : goodSet × Grid := (ω.1.1, ω.2)

/-! ### The marked re-rooting -/

/-- **The marked re-rooting of the two-grid space.**  The environment is read off the inner
factor, the dyadic system `𝔻'` is the *outer* grid, and re-rooting acts simultaneously on the
good marked configuration and on the auxiliary grid. -/

/-! ### Pulling the manuscript's invariant domain back along an intertwiner -/

/-- **The manuscript's invariant domain pulls back along any map intertwining the two actions.**

`SimilarityBlockAveraging.InvariantDomain` has four conditions, and all four are preserved by a
measurable `f` which intertwines the re-rootings and the dilations: measurability and dilation
invariance are pointwise, the Lebesgue-null set of bad re-rootings is the *same* set of offsets
downstairs, and conullity is the hypothesis `hae`.

Conullity is asked for directly rather than through `μ.map f = μ'`, because the two-grid and
three-grid laws reach it from `Measure.quasiMeasurePreserving_fst` without ever computing a
pushforward.  `μ'` enters only through the type of `hdom'`. -/

/-! ### The invariant domain and the selected-block data -/

/-- **The manuscript's invariant domain on the two-grid space.**  All four conditions of
`SimilarityBlockAveraging.InvariantDomain` are inherited from the one-grid domain
`GoodMarkedScaleAction.invariantDomain_coveredMarked` through `proj`, which intertwines the
re-rooting and the dilation.

`coveredAux` is *measurable* (`measurableSet_coveredAux`), *conull* — this is the manuscript's
Lemma 2.4, `ReflectedGMS.ae_zero_notMem_uncoveredSet`, transported to the two-grid law, and it
needs `s:eq:MTP` — *left by only a Lebesgue-null set of re-rootings* (the `H¹`-null uncovered set
of the environment itself), and *invariant under the dilation action* (dilations fix the origin).
So it is not an empty or degenerate gate: it carries full measure. -/

/-- **The manuscript's selected-block data on the auxiliary two-grid marked space**, from
`s:eq:MTP` and the good set, read on the invariant domain `coveredAux`.  Four fields transfer
definitionally from the one-grid space; the transport identity is
`lintegral_blockAverageLint_aux` and is **not** gated — it tests every measurable scale-invariant
kernel and never looks at the origin chain. -/
