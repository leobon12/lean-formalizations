# Marked conditional block averaging

This module carries out the measure-theoretic half of the manuscript lemma
"Conditional block averaging" (`s:lem:conditional`, Section "Spatial tools
without a joint ergodicity assertion") for the *actual* selected dyadic squares
of `ReflectedGMS.DyadicApproximation`.

The geometry is exact, not abstract:

* the dyadic square containing the origin at level `k` is always the index
  `originIndex k = (k, 0)`, because `Grid.origin_position` normalises the
  relative origin to its own square.  `parent_originIndex` and
  `ancestor_originIndex` identify the whole origin ancestor chain;
* `OriginSelected F D m k` is the manuscript's `S_m(0) = S` for the concrete
  `DyadicApproximation.Selected` threshold, and along the origin chain it is
  unique (`originSelected_unique`) and exists (`exists_originSelected`) by the
  checked selection results of `ReflectedGMS.DiameterBlockIndex`;
* `blockSet` is the half-open selected origin square, so the selected squares
  really partition the plane and the re-rooted block of an interior point is a
  translate of the original block.

On top of this geometry a marked configuration space is a measurable space
`Ω` with an environment observable, a further independent dyadic system
(`MarkedReRooting.grid`, the manuscript's `𝔻'`) and a measurable re-rooting
action `ω ↦ ω - z`.  The block average

`A_m U (ω) = ℓ(S_m(0))⁻² ∫_{S_m(0)} U (ω - z) dz`

is `MarkedReRooting.blockAverageLint` (nonnegative form) and
`MarkedReRooting.blockAverage` (Bochner form).

The results proved here are exactly the conditional-expectation half of the
lemma:

* `MarkedReRooting.blockSigma` is the sigma-field of measurable events whose
  indicator is unchanged by re-rooting at a point of the selected origin block,
  and `blockSigma_le` makes it a sub-sigma-field;
* `blockAverageLint_indicator` is the manuscript's step "inside the origin block
  `1_B` is unchanged", i.e. `A_m (1_B U) = 1_B A_m U`;
* `blockAverageLint_shift` is the invariance of `A_m` under every allowed
  re-rooting, hence `measurable_blockSigma_blockAverageLint`: `A_m` is
  `𝒢_m`-measurable;
* `setLIntegral_blockAverageLint` is the testing identity
  `E[1_B A_m U] = E[1_B U]` for invariant `B`;
* `blockAverage_ae_eq_condExp` concludes `A_m F = E[F | 𝒢_m]`.

The single probabilistic input is `MarkedReRooting.MarkedBlockTransport`: the
mark-averaged mass-transport identity `E[A_m U] = E[U]`, i.e. the manuscript's
marked transport `T(ω, 𝔻', w, z) = 1_{z ∈ S_m(w)} ℓ(S_m(w))⁻² U(ω - z)` read
through `EnvironmentLaws.MassTransport` after averaging over the independent
marks.  Its producer — the covariant kernel construction for the re-rooting
action together with the similarity invariance of the mark law — is *not*
proved here and is exposed as this explicit hypothesis, together with the
measurability data of the selected block (`BlockEquivariant`, the measurable
block graph and the measurable block side length).  No tail triviality and no
joint grid ergodicity is used anywhere.

/-! ### The conditional-expectation identity for a sub-sigma-field of `𝒢_m`

The manuscript's `𝒢_m` also requires invariance under common scaling, and its mass
transport is applied only to *scale-invariant* test functions `U = 1_B F`.  The variant
below therefore takes an arbitrary sub-sigma-field `𝒢 ≤ blockSigma m` together with the
transport identity tested only on `1_A · U` for `A ∈ 𝒢`; the similarity-invariant
sigma-field is an instance, and `MarkedBlockTransport` is the instance `𝒢 = blockSigma m`. -/

domain and sets the construction to zero off it, so under the singular-set covering clause
`μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0` the invariance is available only at almost every configuration.

/-- **Conditional block averaging on an invariant domain.**  If the block average of `f` is
measurable for a sub-sigma-field `𝒢` whose events are block invariant **almost surely**, and
the mark-averaged transport identity holds for the test functions `1_A f`, `A ∈ 𝒢`, then
`A_m f = E[f | 𝒢]`.

This is the form the manuscript actually uses: `𝒢` is the sigma-field of events invariant
under re-rooting inside the block *and* under common scaling, `1_A f` is scale invariant, and
§3.1 asks for the block invariance only on a measurable invariant domain — which, under the
singular-set covering clause `μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0`, is all that is available, the
selected block being undefined at an uncovered origin.  `blockAverage_ae_eq_condExp_of_sigma`
is the everywhere-invariant original, recovered below at no loss. -/
