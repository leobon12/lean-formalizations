# `s:prop:maximal` for the rooted (FE) density, from `s:eq:MTP` and the (FE) moment

This module closes the spatial maximal inequality for the actual environment law.  Its main
theorem is the consumers' hypothesis `hMax`, now a **theorem**:

`ae_exists_ballBound_rootedFiniteEnergyDensity (ν) [IsProbabilityMeasure ν]
  (hν : MassTransport ν) (hFE : ∫⁻ ρ_FE(𝓗_e)(0) dν ≠ ∞) :
  ∀ᵐ e ∂ν, ∃ M ≠ ∞, ∀ r > 0, ∫_{B̄_r} ρ_FE(𝓗_e) ≤ r² M`,

i.e. the third clause of manuscript Proposition `s:prop:maximal` for the (FE) functional, with
**no hypothesis beyond the manuscript's own** `s:eq:MTP` and finite (FE) moment.  The
consumers are then discharged verbatim at the end of the file: `s:eq:Wbound`
(`ae_spatialDiameterCellBounds`), the block interpolant and `s:lem:smallblocks` for the
concrete interpolant (rows `n = 1`, `n = 16`), the hypotheses of `r:prop:log`, and the
recurrence-lane quenched wrapper.

## The last producer: the marked block transport from `s:eq:MTP`

`Spatial/GoodMarkedSpace` and `Spatial/GoodMarkedScaleAction` supply every field of
`SimilarityBlockAveraging.SimilarityBlockDataOn … coveredMarked` except the transport identity
`E[A_m U] = E[U]` for scale-invariant `U`.  That identity is the manuscript's application of
marked mass transport to

`T(ω, w, z) = 1_{z ∈ S_m(w)} ℓ(S_m(w))⁻² U(ω − z)`,

*"for an arbitrary nonnegative scale-invariant `U`"*.  Here:

* `goodBlockKernel m U` is that kernel on the good marked space (`S_m(w)` is the selected
  origin block of the configuration re-rooted at `w`, translated back);
* `blockKernel m U` is its extension by zero to the actual marked space `Env × Grid`, along
  the measurable embedding of the good cylinder;
* `markedSimilarityCovariant_blockKernel` is `s:eq:Tcov` for it — degree `−2` under the full
  similarity group — from the scale covariance of the blocks, the compatibility of the two
  actions and the scale invariance of `U` (`goodBlockKernel_dilate_shift`); off the good set
  both sides vanish because the good set is stable under similarities in both directions;
* `Corrector/MarkedMassTransportProducer.markedMassTransport_of_massTransport` then yields the
  transport identity on `ν ⊗ gridMeasure` from `MassTransport ν` alone, and
  `lintegral_prod_eq_lintegral_goodLaw` moves it to the good marked law;
* the outgoing integral at the origin is the block average `A_m U` and the incoming integral
  is `U` (the partition identity `0 ∈ S_m(z) ↔ z ∈ S_m(0)` and `volume S_m(0) = ℓ²`):
  `lintegral_blockAverageLint_eq`.

Nothing is assumed: every input is checked upstream, and the manuscript's argument is followed
step by step.

/-! ### The manuscript's invariant domain, inside the kernel

Under the singular-set manuscript's covering clause the selected origin block is undefined at an
uncovered origin, so `GoodMarkedScaleAction.blockScaleCovariantOn_goodScale` and
`GoodMarkedSpace.blockEquivariantOn_goodMarked` hold only on `GoodMarkedSpace.coveredMarked`.
But `MassTransport` tests kernels that are similarity covariant **pointwise**, so the block
transport must stay *exactly* covariant.

The repair is to build the domain into the kernel's support: the transport is required to
re-root at a **covered** source point, i.e. `goodMarked.shift w ω ∈ coveredMarked`.  That
condition is itself exactly similarity covariant (`goodDilate_mem_coveredMarked_iff` together
with the compatibility `hshift` of the two actions), so the kernel remains exactly covariant of
degree `−2`; off it both sides of `s:eq:Tcov` vanish.  The two boundary integrals then survive:
the outgoing one at `w = 0` is unchanged on the domain, and the incoming one loses only the
uncovered `z`, a Lebesgue-null set of offsets (`volume_shift_notMem_coveredMarked`, the
manuscript's *"hence Lebesgue-almost every point of the plane"*).

**No regression**: when every origin is covered the added condition is vacuous
(`coveredMarked_eq_univ`) and every statement below is literally the old one; the ungated
`similarityBlockData_goodMarked` is kept and reproved from the gated data. -/

/-- Dilating about the origin fixes the origin, so it does not move the covered-origin
condition.  This is the `dilate_mem` field of
`GoodMarkedScaleAction.invariantDomain_coveredMarked` without the measure that structure is
packaged with; this file needs it before any law is in sight. -/

/-- The incoming integral at the origin is `U` itself, **on the invariant domain**: the selected
blocks partition the plane and `volume S_m(0) = ℓ(S_m(0))²`.

Here the source point is the integration variable `z`, so the domain condition in the support
excludes the uncovered offsets.  Those form a Lebesgue-null set
(`GoodMarkedSpace.volume_shift_notMem_coveredMarked`, the manuscript's *"hence Lebesgue-almost
every point of the plane"*), so the identity survives with an almost-everywhere comparison in
place of the pointwise one. -/
