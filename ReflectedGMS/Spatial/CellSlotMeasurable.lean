# Measurability of cell membership and of code slots

These are the joint-measurability facts about the Hausdorff Borel structure on cells and about
reading a code slot.  They were originally proved inside `Spatial/NullBoundaryRoots.lean`; they are
collected here, **unchanged and in the same namespace**, so that the two mass-transport arguments
that need them — the frontier transport of `NullBoundaryRoots` and the uncovered transport of
`Spatial/UncoveredRootTransport.lean` — can both use them without one file importing the other.

Moving a declaration to an earlier file in the same namespace is invisible to consumers: every
fully-qualified name is unchanged, and `NullBoundaryRoots` imports this file.
