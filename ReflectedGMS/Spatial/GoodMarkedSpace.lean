# The good marked space: origin-chain regularity, block data and the independent grid

This module instantiates the abstract inputs of the spatial maximal inequality on the
**good marked space** `goodSet × Grid`, where `goodSet` is the set of environments with finite
large-cell diameter at every radius and sublinear large-cell decay
(`GoodEnvironmentSet.GoodEnvironment`, almost sure under `MassTransport ν` and the (FE) moment
by `s:lem:largecells`).

Everything here is unconditional.  For the marked re-rooting `goodMarked` and the law
`goodLaw ν = (ν|_{goodSet}) ⊗ gridMeasure`:

* `coveredMarked` — the manuscript's **measurable invariant domain**: the configurations whose
  origin lies in a cell.  Since the covering clause of `Geometry` was weakened to
  `μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0`, a prescribed point need no longer be covered, and the manuscript
  correspondingly defines the block partition only where it is defined.  The domain is
  measurable (`measurableSet_coveredMarked`), conull (`ae_mem_coveredMarked`, the manuscript's
  Lemma 2.4) and left by only a Lebesgue-null set of re-rootings
  (`volume_shift_notMem_coveredMarked`, the manuscript's *"hence Lebesgue-almost every point of
  the plane"*);
* `originChainRegularOn_goodMarked` — the manuscript's regularity of the origin dyadic chain on
  that domain, with **no hypothesis**.  The everywhere form
  `originChainRegular_goodMarked` is kept, but it carries the hypothesis `CoveredOrigins`, which
  is full covering in disguise (`coveredOrigin_translateEnv`) and is not available under the
  weakened clause; the two agree when the uncovered set is empty;
* `blockEquivariantOn_goodMarked` — re-rooting inside the selected origin block translates it
  (the translation half of "the partitions commute with similarities"), on the domain and with
  no hypothesis; `blockEquivariant_goodMarked` is its `CoveredOrigins` form;
* `measurableBlockGraph_goodMarked` — the selected block is jointly measurable and its side
  length is measurable; **this needs no covering hypothesis at all**, only strict monotonicity
  of `κ` along the origin chain;
* `environmentGrid_goodMarked` — the independent uniform dyadic system `𝔻'`: the grid
  coordinate is independent of the environment sigma-field and carries the uniform dyadic law,
  and the rooted (FE) density is an environment observable (from
  `RootedFiniteEnergyDensityMeasurable`);
* `measurable_rootFE_goodMarked`, `integrable_rootFE_goodLaw` — the (FE) functional is a
  nonnegative integrable observable of the good marked law, from the manuscript's (FE) moment.

The dilation action and the scale-invariant transport identity (the remaining fields of
`SimilarityBlockAveraging.SimilarityBlockData`) are supplied elsewhere.

/-! ### Origin-chain regularity, pathwise on the good space -/

/-- **Every good environment has its origin in a cell.**

This is an explicit hypothesis, and under the weakened covering clause of `Geometry`
(`μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0` in place of `⋃ v, cell v = Set.univ`) it cannot be discharged —
neither here nor by strengthening `goodSet`.  The reason is structural rather than technical:

* `goodMarked` is `SpatialMaximalConsumerForm.goodReRooting`, whose shift is defined for **every**
  `w : Plane`, so its carrier `goodSet` must satisfy `goodSet_translateEnv`: it is closed under
  every translation of the environment.
* `uncoveredSet (decode (translateEnv w e))` is the translate of `uncoveredSet (decode e)`
  (`Spatial.envCoveredSet_of_isSimilarity` at `IsSimilarity 1 w`), so `CoveredOrigins` holding at
  every translate of a good environment says that **every** point of that environment is covered,
  i.e. `uncoveredSet (decode e) = ∅`.  `coveredOrigin_translateEnv` records this closure.
* `ReflectedGMS.ae_zero_notMem_uncoveredSet` (`Spatial/CoveredOrigin.lean`) — the manuscript's
  Lemma 2.4 — gives only
  `∀ᵐ e ∂ν, (0 : Plane) ∉ uncoveredSet (decode e)`, a statement **at the origin**; and
  `∀ᵐ e ∂ν, uncoveredSet (decode e) = ∅` is precisely what the singular-set manuscript declines
  to assume.  Nor can the condition be folded into `goodSet`: it would have to be simultaneously
  translation closed, measurable and `ν`-conull, and full covering is neither of the last two.

So under the weakened covering clause `OriginChainRegular goodMarked` is **false** (see
`GoodEnvironmentSet.exists_blockIndex_originIndex_le` for an explicit configuration in `goodSet`
whose origin chain has `κ` bounded below), and the manuscript does not claim it: it defines the
selected block `S_m(z)` only at covered `z` and sets the construction to zero elsewhere.  The
corresponding Lean repair is to weaken the `index_small` field of
`SpatialMaximalInequality.OriginChainRegular` from "at every `ω`" to "at almost every shift",
which is available — for `ν`-a.e. environment the uncovered set is Lebesgue-null
(`volume_uncoveredSet`), so Lebesgue-a.e. shift has a covered origin — but which is a change to a
structure this module only consumes. -/
def CoveredOrigins : Prop := ∀ e : Env, e ∈ goodSet → (0 : Plane) ∉ uncoveredSet (decode e)

/-- **`CoveredOrigins` is a full-covering hypothesis in disguise.**  `goodSet` is closed under
every translation of the environment (`goodSet_translateEnv`), so `CoveredOrigins` applies at every
translate of every good environment; and translating an environment translates its uncovered set
(`Spatial.envCoveredSet_of_isSimilarity` at `IsSimilarity 1 w`), so this says that no point of a
good environment is uncovered.

This is the machine-checked half of the argument in `CoveredOrigins`' docstring for why the
hypothesis cannot be discharged from the manuscript's Lemma 2.4, which is a statement about the
origin only. -/
theorem coveredOrigin_translateEnv (h : CoveredOrigins) (e : Env) (he : e ∈ goodSet) (w : Plane) :
    (0 : Plane) ∉ uncoveredSet (decode (translateEnv w e)) :=
  h (translateEnv w e) (goodSet_translateEnv w e he)

/-- **The origin dyadic chain is regular at every point of the good space**, given that every
good environment has its origin in a cell.  The three clauses are the checked pathwise results of
`GoodEnvironmentSet`, applied to the good environment carried by the point; only the third needs
`hcov`, the first two surviving the weakened covering clause unaided because
`NonmacroscopicSelectedBlocks.maxCellDiameter_pos` needs a covered point merely somewhere in the
square and the covered points are dense.  See `CoveredOrigins` for why `hcov` is not removable,
and `originChainRegularOn_goodMarked` for the manuscript's own hypothesis-free form. -/

This is the set `CoveredOrigins` asks to be everything.  It is not everything, and cannot be

dilation action, and — this is the manuscript's *"and hence Lebesgue-almost every point of the
