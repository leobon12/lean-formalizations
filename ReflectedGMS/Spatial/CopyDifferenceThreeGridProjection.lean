# The weld: `hcopies`' maximal input from the three-grid space

`Spatial/CopyDifferenceThreeGridSpace` builds `TriSpace = ((goodSet × Grid) × Grid) × Grid`
together with its `OriginChainRegularOn`, `SimilarityBlockDataOn`, `InvariantDomain` and
`EnvironmentGrid` — the first two read, as the singular-set manuscript's §3.1 requires, on the
invariant domain `coveredTri` of configurations whose origin lies in a cell — and
`Corrector/CopyDifferenceDensitySimilarity` proves the two pathwise identities `hcov`, `hinv` for
the copy-difference density.  This module supplies the consumer projection

```
couplProj ω = (environment, 𝔻₁, 𝔻₂) : CoupledSpace = Env × Grid × Grid
```

— the two **interpolation** grids, as opposed to `triProj`, which reads the auxiliary grid `𝔻'` —
and feeds everything to `Corrector/GatedWeakMaximalOn.copyDifferenceWeakMaximal_of_twoGridSpaceOn`.

## What is DISCHARGED and what is REDUCED

* **DISCHARGED.**  Every marked-space hypothesis of the consumer head — `hdom`, `hchain`,
  `hdata`, `henv`, `hprojA`, `hmap`, and now also `hcov` and `hinv` — is a *proof* here, from the
  manuscript's own `s:eq:MTP` and finite (FE) moment.  In particular there is no
  `MeasurableEmbedding` (which is false for any projection off a product) and no pathwise gate
  (the copy-difference field contains no `phi`).
* **REDUCED.**  `copyDifferenceWeakMaximal_threeGrid` reduces
  `GridIndependenceDifferenceBridge.CopyDifferenceWeakMaximal` to `hmeas` alone, the assembly's own
  measurability of the gated interpolant — the same residue as `hsub`, `hpatch` and `hconv`.
* Composing with `Corrector/CopyDifferenceOriginEnergy.differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_originEnergy`,
  `differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_originEnergy_threeGrid` reduces **`hcopies` itself to the
  single input `hzero`**, the manuscript's cross orthogonality in its integrability-free
  `ℝ≥0∞` form.  By
  `Corrector/CopyDifferenceInputReduction.integral_rootedPairing_diff_self_eq` that is the
  irreducible content of `hcopies`, so no further count reduction is possible along this route.

## Why the third grid is genuinely needed

`R.grid` cannot be collapsed onto either interpolation copy: `hprojA` makes both grid components
of `couplProj` `𝒜.sigma`-measurable, `henv.indep` makes `R.grid` independent of `𝒜.sigma`, and
`henv.law` forces `μ.map R.grid` to be a `UniformGridLaw`, not a Dirac.

## Anti-vacuity

`TriSpace` is inhabited at the actual data (`CopyDifferenceThreeGridSpace.nonempty_triSpace`,
re-exported by the `example` at the end), the constant in `CopyDifferenceWeakMaximal` is the
project's absolute `512`, produced outside the `∀ t` quantifier by the consumer head, and the
three-grid law is a probability measure.  The gate is not an unsatisfiable hypothesis hiding the
old falsity: `CopyDifferenceThreeGridSpace.invariantDomain_coveredTri` proves `coveredTri`
measurable, **conull for the three-grid law**, invariant under the dilation action and left by
only a Lebesgue-null set of re-rootings.

`TriSpace`. -/

/-! ### `hcopies`' maximal input -/

/-- **`hcopies`' maximal input, produced — not assumed — from the auxiliary three-grid marked
space.**

`Corrector/GatedWeakMaximalOn.copyDifferenceWeakMaximal_of_twoGridSpaceOn` is the embedding-free
consumer head on the manuscript's invariant domain; every one of its hypotheses — the marked-space
data `hdom`, `hchain`, `hdata`, `henv`, the projection conditions `hprojA`, `hmap`, and the two
pathwise identities `hcov`, `hinv` — is discharged here.  What remains on the right of the arrow
is `hmeas`, the
assembly's own measurability of the gated interpolant, which has nothing to do with the auxiliary
dyadic system.

So this is a **DISCHARGE** of the marked-space producer for `hcopies`, and a **REDUCTION** of
`CopyDifferenceWeakMaximal` to `hmeas` alone (beyond the manuscript's own `s:eq:MTP` and finite
(FE) moment) — the same residue as `hsub`, `hpatch` and `hconv`. -/

/-- **`hcopies` from the single input `hzero`.**

`Corrector/CopyDifferenceOriginEnergy.differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_originEnergy` reduced
`hcopies` to the pair `(hzero, hmax)`; the second member is now a theorem, so `hcopies` costs
exactly one statement beyond the manuscript's own hypotheses and the assembly's `hmeas`:

  `hzero : E[ ρ_{Φ¹ − Φ²}(0) ] = 0`,

the expected rooted specific-energy density at the origin of the difference of the two grid-copy
potentials.  By `Corrector/CopyDifferenceInputReduction.integral_rootedPairing_diff_self_eq` and
the pointwise nonnegativity of the self-pairing, `hzero` *is* the manuscript's cross
orthogonality; it is the irreducible content of `hcopies` and no further bookkeeping removes
it. -/
