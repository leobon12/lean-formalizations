# The spatial maximal inequality

This module proves the manuscript proposition "Spatial maximal inequality"
(`s:prop:maximal`, manuscript lines 311-339): for a nonnegative integrable
functional `F` of the marked configuration, the density `ρ_ω(z) = F(ω - z)` is
locally integrable almost surely,

`P[M(ρ) > λ] ≤ 512 E[F] / λ`,   `M(ρ) = sup_{R > 0} R⁻² ∫_{B̄_R} ρ(z) dz`,

and in particular `M(ρ) < ∞` almost surely.

All three clauses are proved here (`spatial_maximal_inequality`), in the
manuscript's order of ideas and with the manuscript's constants:

* `measure_exists_originAverage_gt_le` is `s:eq:dyadicmax` extended to the
  *complete* origin dyadic chain.  Doob's reverse weak-`L¹` inequality is not
  redone: the checked `ReverseConditional.measure_exists_rat_lt_abs_condExp_le`
  is applied to the decreasing family `𝒢_{param q}` of block-invariant
  sigma-fields, and the conditional expectations are replaced by the actual
  block averages through the checked
  `MarkedBlockAveraging.blockAverage_ae_eq_condExp`.  The passage from the
  countable parameter family to *every* origin dyadic square is the manuscript's
  "every origin dyadic square occurs for an interval of parameters containing a
  rational" (`exists_param_originSelected`): the selection threshold
  `κ(S) ≤ m < κ(parent S)` is an interval in `m`, and the parametrisation
  `param q = exp q` is monotone with dense range in `(0, ∞)`.
* `measure_ballMaximal_gt_le` is `s:eq:maximal`.  Following the manuscript, a
  *rational* radius is chosen measurably from the unmarked environment **before**
  the independent dyadic system `𝔻'` is used (`exists_rat_ballAverage`, which
  replaces the manuscript's continuity of `R ↦ ∫_{B̄_R} ρ` by passing to a
  slightly larger rational radius, so that no local integrability is needed
  yet).  Only then is `𝔻'` used: conditionally on its phase, its level of side
  length `ℓ ∈ [8R, 16R)` has its origin square containing `B̄_R` with probability
  at least `(3/4)² > 1/2` (`half_le_measure_goodGrid`), and on that event the
  origin square average exceeds `λ/256` (`originAverage_gt_of_ball`).  The
  countable decomposition over the rational radii turns the conditioning into an
  honest product formula, so no conditional-expectation machinery and no
  translation stationarity of the environment law is used: the auxiliary grid is
  independent of the environment sigma-field and carries the uniform dyadic law
  `DyadicApproximation.UniformGridLaw`.
* `ballMaximal_lt_top_ae` and `integrableOn_density_ae` are the finiteness and
  the local integrability, obtained *from* the tail bound; this is the reason the
  rational radius is produced without assuming local integrability.

Everything about the selected blocks is reused from
`ReflectedGMS.Spatial.MarkedBlockAveraging`.  Three producer dependencies remain
explicit hypotheses, exactly as in that module:

* `BlockData` collects, for every positive parameter, the selected-block
  measurability data and the mark-averaged mass transport
  `MarkedReRooting.MarkedBlockTransport`.  This is where the manuscript's
  *scale invariance* of the integrand enters: the transport identity
  `E[A_m U] = E[U]` is the marked mass transport applied to a scale-invariant
  integrand, and it is not reproved here.
* `OriginChainRegular` is the geometric regularity of the origin ancestor chain
  (finiteness of `κ`, divergence of the inverse ratios, and arbitrarily small
  `κ` at fine levels) which makes the selected origin block `S_m(0)` exist and be
  unique at *every* positive parameter.  Strict monotonicity of `κ` along the
  chain is not assumed: it is derived from these through the checked
  `MarkedBlockAveraging.strictMono_blockIndex_originIndex`.
  Its third clause is **false** under the singular-set manuscript's covering clause
  `μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0`, and the manuscript does not claim it; `OriginChainRegularOn`
  below is the manuscript's own form, with that clause asked only on an invariant domain, and
  `blockSigmaOn` is the sigma-field that goes with it.  The two forms agree at the full
  domain, so nothing proved here is weakened under full covering.
* `EnvironmentGrid` is the independence of `𝔻'` from the unmarked environment
  sigma-field together with its uniform dyadic law.  No trivial invariant
  sigma-field and no translation stationarity is assumed anywhere.

/-! ### The manuscript's form: origin-chain regularity on an invariant domain

`OriginChainRegular.index_small` — `κ` drops below every positive level along the origin chain
of **every** configuration — is *false* under the singular-set manuscript's covering clause
`μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0`.  The manuscript asks for `κ(S) ≤ 2 ℓ(S)/d_H` along a chain
containing a point `z ∈ H` of a cell, and says explicitly that *"no claim is needed about an
uncovered singular point"*; `GoodEnvironmentSet.exists_blockIndex_originIndex_le` records an
explicit configuration — the annuli `2^{-n-1} ≤ ‖x‖_∞ ≤ 2^{-n}` tiled by squares of side
`2^{-n²}` — that satisfies every clause of `Geometry`, has uncovered set `{0}`, and along whose
origin chain `κ` stays bounded below.

The manuscript's own form of §3.1 is *"the closures of the blocks cover every point belonging to
a cell, and hence Lebesgue-almost every point of the plane … undefined constructions are set to
zero off their invariant domain"*.  `OriginChainRegularOn R G` is that statement: the two chain
clauses at **every** configuration — both survive the weakened covering clause unaided, since
`NonmacroscopicSelectedBlocks.maxCellDiameter_pos` needs a covered point merely *somewhere* in
the square and the covered points are dense — and `index_small` only on the domain `G`.

Nothing here needs `G` measurable; the consumers use it with `G` conull, through the
almost-sure block sigma-field `blockSigmaOn` below.

**No regression.**  `OriginChainRegular.on` turns the everywhere form into the gated one at any
`G`, and `OriginChainRegularOn.toOriginChainRegular` turns the gated form at `G = univ` back;
`blockSigmaOn_univ` identifies the gated sigma-field with `blockSigma` there.  So under the
earlier manuscript's covering clause `⋃ v, cell v = univ`, where `uncoveredSet F = ∅`, every
conclusion below is exactly as strong as the ungated one. -/

/-- **Regularity of the origin ancestor chain on an invariant domain `G`** — the manuscript's

every allowed re-rooting inside the selected origin block, **at the configurations of `G`**.

It is *larger* than `blockSigma m` (`blockSigma_le_blockSigmaOn`) and equal to it at
`G = univ` (`blockSigmaOn_univ`), so replacing `blockSigma` by it never weakens a conclusion
under full covering.  Being larger is exactly what the consumers need: the block average has to
be measurable for it (easier), while the transport identity it is tested against holds for every
measurable scale-invariant test function and does not see the gate at all. -/
