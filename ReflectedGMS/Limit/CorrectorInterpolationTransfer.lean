# Corrector and interpolation transfer

This file proves the manuscript's transfer step at `tex:1648-1652`, the paragraph
of the proof of Theorem `p:thm:areaclt` which reads

> By compact containment, with probability arbitrarily close to one the spatial
> path through time `T/ε²` lies in `B̄(R/ε)`.  On that event `(p:eq:corrector)`
> gives `sup_{t≤T} ε|Z_{t/ε²} - M_{t/ε²}| → 0`.  The assertion extends from vertex
> times to all times by their right-continuous extensions. … Its interpolation
> error is bounded by the largest ordinary spatial jump whose preceding holding
> interval meets the time interval. … The estimate `|z_H - z_{H'}| ≤ d_H + d_{H'}`,
> together with `(p:eq:mesh)`, makes that error `o(1)` after scaling.

Everything here is **deterministic and pathwise**, exactly as in the manuscript:
the probabilistic half of the paragraph ("with probability arbitrarily close to
one") is compact containment, which is the separate Lemma `p:lem:lindeberg`, and
enters below only as the hypothesis `‖Z t‖ ≤ R/ε` — the manuscript's "on that
event".  Nothing here asserts compact containment, and nothing here constructs a
corrector.

## Inputs

* `z` are cell representatives (`StatementIngredients.CellRepresentatives`);
* `hsub : UniformlySublinearError F Φ z` is the manuscript's `(p:eq:corrector)`;
* `hdiam : SubmacroscopicDiameters F` is the manuscript's `D_R = o(R)` from
  `(p:eq:mesh)`, already proved by `Spatial.maxDiamHittingBall_sublinear` and
  bridged by `CoercivitySmallJumps.submacroscopicDiameters_of_finite_scaledNear`.

These are the same two inputs used by the immediately preceding manuscript lemma
`p:lem:coercive`, formalized in `ReflectedGMS.Limit.CoercivitySmallJumps`, whose
geometry helpers are reused throughout.

## Results

* `exists_pos_forall_scaled_correctorError_le` — the scaled corrector error
  `ε‖z_H - Φ(H)‖` is uniformly below `δ` over all cells with `‖z_H‖ ≤ R/ε`, once
  `ε` is small.  This is the display at `tex:1650` at vertex level.
* `norm_representative_sub_le_diam_add_diam` — the manuscript's displayed
  estimate `|z_H - z_{H'}| ≤ d_H + d_{H'}` across an ordinary edge.
* `exists_pos_forall_scaled_neighborRepresentativeGap_le` — its scaled,
  submacroscopic-diameter consequence: `ε‖z_{H'} - z_H‖ ≤ δ`.  It is obtained by
  *reusing* `CoercivitySmallJumps.exists_pos_forall_neighbor_smallJump` with the
  corrector taken to be `z` itself, via `uniformlySublinearError_self`.
* `exists_pos_forall_scaled_spatialExtension_sub_le` — the display at `tex:1650`
  for the actual pathwise spatial extensions: `Z` the extension of the path
  through the representatives `z`, and `M` the extension through the harmonic
  coordinate `Φ`.  These are exactly the two objects appearing in
  `InvarianceMainStatement.RegularSpatialExtension`, whose conjunction over one
  common lift is what `FixedStartConclusions` and
  `RepresentativePathConclusions` carry.
* `exists_pos_forall_scaled_interpolation_sub_le` — the interpolation clause of
  `tex:1652`: the *continuous* interpolation `Ztilde` of the representative path
  (`SpatialEnds.IsContinuousInterpolation`, the object whose law is compared to
  the Brownian target in `RepresentativePathConclusions`) stays within `δ/ε` of
  the harmonic martingale path `M` at every vertex-valued time of the contained
  region.  This combines the two previous bounds.
* `le_of_forall_vertexTime_le` and
  `exists_pos_forall_scaled_interpolation_sub_le_allTimes` — the first sentence
  of `tex:1652`, "the assertion extends from vertex times to all times by their
  right-continuous extensions".

**Conditionality.**  `le_of_forall_vertexTime_le` and
`exists_pos_forall_scaled_interpolation_sub_le_allTimes` carry the additional
explicit hypothesis `RightDenseVertexTimes F X`: the vertex-valued times of the
path are right-dense.  This is exactly what "by their right-continuous
extensions" presupposes, and it is *not* implied by the predicates
`IsSpatialExtension` / `IsContinuousInterpolation` alone — a path that is
end-valued on a whole time interval satisfies those predicates with an arbitrary
continuous value there.  It is a genuinely open input about the reflected walk,
not proved here.  Every other theorem in this file is unconditional given the two
manuscript inputs above.

None of this certifies the existence of a harmonic coordinate: `Φ` and its
sublinearity are hypotheses.

/-! ## The scaled corrector error on a contained region -/

/-- **Manuscript `tex:1648-1651`, vertex level.**  For each fixed `R ≥ 0` and each
`δ > 0` there is `ε₀ > 0` such that for every `0 < ε ≤ ε₀`, every cell whose
representative lies in `B̄(0, R/ε)` satisfies `ε‖z_H - Φ(H)‖ ≤ δ`.

This is the whole content of "on that event `(p:eq:corrector)` gives
`sup_{t≤T} ε|Z_{t/ε²} - M_{t/ε²}| → 0`": the sublinear error is `o(R/ε)` at the
radius `R/ε` reached by the contained path, and `ε · o(R/ε) → 0`.  Only the
corrector sublinearity is used; no geometry and no diameter bound. -/

`|z_H - z_{H'}| ≤ d_H + d_{H'}` combined with `(p:eq:mesh)`, and it is the bound

/-! ## Transfer to the pathwise spatial extensions -/

/-! ## Transfer to the continuous interpolation -/

/-- **Manuscript `tex:1652`, interpolation clause.**  `Ztilde` is the continuous
interpolation of the representative path over its complete holding intervals
(`SpatialEnds.IsContinuousInterpolation`; this is the object whose law is
compared with the Brownian target in
`InvarianceMainStatement.RepresentativePathConclusions`), and `M` is the harmonic
spatial extension of the same path.  At every vertex-valued time of the contained
region the scaled difference is at most `δ`, once `ε` is small: the corrector
error contributes at most `δ/2`, and the interpolation error — bounded by the
ordinary spatial jump `|z_H - z_{H'}| ≤ d_H + d_{H'}` of its own holding
interval — contributes at most `δ/2`. -/

by times at which the path sits at an actual vertex.  This is what the
