# The grid-probability transfer of `p:prop:timeergodic`, and the block data of `hblk`

`ReflectedGMS/Limit/BracketTimeAverage.lean` reduced the bracket law of large numbers for
`Φ(Y)` to a single named input, its `hblk`:

```
∀ δ > 0, ∀ᶠ T in atTop, ∃ J, MeasurableSet J ∧ Ioc 0 T ⊆ J ∧
  volume J ≤ ENNReal.ofReal ((1 + δ) * T) ∧ IntegrableOn f J volume ∧ setAvg J f ≤ c + δ
```

## A correction: `hblk` is not a reduction

`hblk` is **equivalent** to the conclusion it is used to prove.  Given the Cesàro bound
`∀ᶠ T, (∫₀ᵀ f)/T ≤ c + δ` one takes `J = Ioc 0 T`: it is measurable, contains `Ioc 0 T`,
has `volume J = ENNReal.ofReal T ≤ ENNReal.ofReal ((1+δ)T)`, and `setAvg (Ioc 0 T) f` **is**
the interval average (`BracketTimeAverage.directionalAverage_eq_setAvg`).  So nothing is
gained by producing `hblk` pathwise, and — more importantly — the manuscript never does.

The manuscript's transfer step (tex:1553-1562) is a **contradiction argument over the
independent uniform time grid**: it never exhibits a tight origin block for all large `T`,
only for the `T`'s along one witness sequence and only for a grid drawn from a set of
probability at least the constant `p_δ` of `p:eq:gridprob`.  This module carries out that
argument.  `intervalAverage_le_of_gridChainData` is the manuscript's upper bound and is the
genuine replacement for `hblk`.

## What is proved here

Fix one trajectory, i.e. one nonnegative density `f` on the time axis.  `GridChainData`
bundles the two probabilistic inputs the manuscript uses, both about the **grid law `ν`
alone**:

* `grid` — `p:eq:gridprob`: for every `δ > 0` there is a strictly positive `p_δ` such that
  for every `T > 0` the grid event `gridBlockEvent blk δ T` (some root block contains
  `(0,T]` and has length at most `(1+δ)T`) has probability at least `p_δ`.  The constant
  must depend on `δ` — as `δ ↓ 0` these events decrease to "a root block has length exactly
  `T`", which is null, so a `δ`-uniform positive constant would make the hypothesis
  unsatisfiable — but it must **not** depend on `T`, and does not, by scale invariance of
  the grid law;
* `chain` — the conclusion of `p:lem:timeconverge` read in the manuscript's own
  "all sufficiently long root blocks" form: for `ν`-almost every grid, every root block of
  length at least some `R = R(η)` has block average within `η` of `μ`.

From these:

* `intervalAverage_le_of_gridChainData` — the manuscript's **upper bound**
  `limsup_T T⁻¹∫₀ᵀ f ≤ μ`, for a general nonnegative `f`, with no boundedness assumption.
  This is the whole content of the transfer step; the proof is the manuscript's:
  a witness sequence `T_n → ∞`, the positive grid probability, continuity from above for
  the tail of the witness events, and one grid realisation that is simultaneously good for
  the chain and tight around arbitrarily large witnesses.
* `le_intervalAverage_of_gridChainData` — the manuscript's **lower bound** for a bounded
  nonnegative density, obtained exactly as the manuscript does it, by applying the upper
  bound to `K - f` (`GridChainData.constSub`).
* `HasBlockData` and `tendsto_intervalAverage_of_hasBlockData` — the two bounds plus the
  manuscript's truncation (tex:1561, "apply the bounded result to `F ∧ K` and let
  `K ↑ ∞`") give the Cesàro limit `T⁻¹∫₀ᵀ f → μ` for an unbounded nonnegative density.
  The truncation family and its means enter as data, because each truncated functional is a
  separate instance of the temporal machinery.
* `canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_blockData` —
  `MartingaleLimit.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit` for the actual quenched array of `Φ(Y)`
  with `hLLN` **and** `BracketTimeAverage.hblk` both discharged, in favour of the block data
  for the three polarization directions of
  `BracketTimeAverage.tendsto_ordinaryEdgeBracket_div_of_directional`.

## What is *not* proved here

The two inputs themselves.  `p:eq:gridprob` is a computation for the one-dimensional marked
dyadic system of `Temporal/ActualDyadicTemporalBlocks`, and the `chain` field is
`Temporal/ConditionalTemporalAveraging.tendsto_setAverageReal_chain_ae` **together with**
the identification of its tail conditional expectation as the constant `𝔼[Γ]`
(`p:lem:regeninvariant` plus environment ergodicity).  Neither is done here, and nothing in
this file certifies `p:prop:timeergodic`, `p:thm:areaclt` or either main theorem.  No
ergodicity, no triviality of a tail σ-field and no time-shift invariance of any law is
assumed or asserted; the hypotheses below mention only the grid law `ν`.

Both probabilistic fields are statements about the **grid law `ν` alone**; the density `f`

/-! ### The upper bound: the manuscript's transfer argument -/

/-- **The transfer step of `p:prop:timeergodic` (tex:1553-1562): the upper bound.**

For a nonnegative density with the block data above, the Cesàro averages over `[0,T]` are
eventually at most `μ + ε`.  No boundedness of `f` is assumed.

The proof is the manuscript's.  Suppose the bound fails frequently.  Fix `δ > 0` small
enough that `(1+δ)(μ + ε/2) < μ + ε`, and choose a witness `T_n ≥ max(n,1)` with
`T_n⁻¹∫₀^{T_n} f > μ + ε` for every `n`.  Each witness event
`gridBlockEvent blk δ T_n` has `ν`-probability at least `p`, so by continuity from above the
set of grids lying in `gridBlockEvent blk δ T_n` for arbitrarily large `n` also has
probability at least `p > 0`; it therefore meets the full-measure set on which the chain
bound holds.  For such a grid, a block `J` tight around a witness longer than the chain
threshold satisfies simultaneously

```
setAvg J f ≤ μ + ε/2     and     setAvg J f ≥ (μ+ε)T_n / ((1+δ)T_n) > μ + ε/2,
```

the second because `f ≥ 0` makes `∫_J f ≥ ∫₀^{T_n} f > (μ+ε)T_n` while `|J| ≤ (1+δ)T_n`.

Each `g K` is a separate unmarked scale-invariant functional, so its chain convergence is a

The truncation clauses are restricted to `0 < K` deliberately: `g K` must be nonnegative

      Tendsto μK atTop (𝓝 μ)

/-- **`p:eq:timeergodic` for one nonnegative density, from the block data.**

The upper bound needs no boundedness; the lower bound is obtained for the truncations and
transported to `f` by `BracketTimeAverage.eventually_le_intervalAverage_mono`, then the
means of the truncations are let go to `μ`.  The squeeze is
`BracketTimeAverage.tendsto_intervalAverage`.

CONDITIONAL on `HasBlockData`; nothing here certifies `p:eq:gridprob`,
`p:lem:timeconverge`, `p:prop:timeergodic`, `p:thm:areaclt` or either main theorem. -/
