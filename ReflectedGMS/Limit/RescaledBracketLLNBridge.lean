# The reparametrisation: the a.s. bracket law of large numbers feeds `RescaledBracketLLN`

The temporal-homogenization route produces the bracket law of large numbers in the shape

```

(`Limit/BracketLLNRegenerativeWeld.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_regenerativeInvariance`,
and before it `Limit/ActualArrayBracketLimit.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit`): almost surely,
locally uniformly, and parameterised by a **real** scale `e` through `Real.toNNReal (s / e ^ 2)`.

The CLT's named input is
`Limit/ApproximateBracketCLTRescaled.RescaledBracketLLN P A C`: along every sequence
`ε : ℕ → ℝ≥0` with `ε k → 0⁺`, at every **fixed** time `t : ℝ≥0` and tolerance `δ > 0`,

```
P {ω | δ < |(ε k) ^ 2 * A ((ε k)⁻¹ ^ 2 * t) ω - C * t|} → 0.
```

This module is the reparametrisation between the two.  There are exactly three things to check,
and none of them is a real mismatch:

* **the time argument.**  `Real.toNNReal ((t : ℝ) / (e : ℝ) ^ 2) = e⁻¹ ^ 2 * t` for **every**
  `e t : ℝ≥0`, with no positivity side condition (`toNNReal_div_sq`): at `e = 0` both sides are
  `0`, because `(0 : ℝ)⁻¹ = 0` and division by `0` is `0`.  So the `ε = 0` worry is vacuous and
  the identity never has to be gated by the eventual positivity of `ε`;
* **the index type.**  A sequence `ε : ℕ → ℝ≥0` with `Tendsto ε atTop (𝓝[>] 0)` coerces to a
  real sequence with `Tendsto (fun k => (ε k : ℝ)) atTop (𝓝[>] 0)` (`tendsto_coe_nhdsWithin`),
  so the real-scale filter limit composes into the sequential one.  Nothing is lost: the real
  statement is the stronger one;
* **the order of limits.**  The locally uniform statement is only ever used at the single point
  `s = t` of `Icc 0 t`, through `TendstoUniformlyOn.tendsto_at`.  The uniformity is therefore
  *not* needed here; it is needed by the other consumer (below), which recovers it from
  monotonicity.

## One hypothesis, two consumers

The `hinc` input of the FCLT lane
(`ApproximateBracketCLTRescaled.rescaledIncrementCharFunLimit_of_bracket_data`, field `hLLN`)
and the `ucp` input of the tightness lane
(`Limit/LocalizedArrayProducer.ThresholdArrayInputs`, reduced to its fixed-time `lln` form by
`Limit/BracketLLNThresholdWiring.thresholdArrayInputs_of_pointwise`) are fed by **the same**
bracket hypothesis.  `lln_of_rescaledBracketLLN` and `thresholdArrayInputs_of_rescaledBracketLLN`
say so: at the rescaled array `V k := rescaledBracket A ε k` the `lln` field is literally an
instance of `RescaledBracketLLN P A C` — weaker, in fact, since `lln` only asks for `t ≤ T`
while `RescaledBracketLLN` asks for all `t` and all scale sequences.

**This is an implication.**  Nothing here certifies the bracket law of large numbers in any
form, nor `p:lem:bracketlimit`, `p:thm:areaclt`, `hinc`, `hlimit` or either main theorem.

# From the almost-sure bracket law of large numbers to the `ucp` field

The temporal-homogenization route produces the bracket law of large numbers **almost surely**
(`Limit/BracketLLNRegenerativeWeld.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_regenerativeInvariance`, and
before it `Limit/ActualArrayBracketLimit.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit`), whereas the `ucp` field
of `Limit/LocalizedArrayProducer.ThresholdArrayInputs` is a statement about measures of *uniform*
bad events.  This module is the bridge, and it is deliberately routed through the **fixed-time**
statement rather than directly.

## Why not go directly from almost-sure uniform convergence

If one already has `∀ᵐ ω, ∀ ε > 0, ∀ᶠ n, ∀ t ∈ [0,T], |V n t ω - v t| ≤ ε`, the `ucp` field still
does not follow, because deducing `P (A n) → 0` from "almost every `ω` is eventually outside
`A n`" needs the sets `A n` to be measurable: an outer measure is not continuous from above, and
`A n = {ω | ∃ t ∈ [0,T], ε < |V n t ω - v t|}` quantifies over an *uncountable* index set, so its
measurability is a genuine side condition (a separability or countable-dense-set reduction of the
path).

Going through the fixed time costs nothing and needs only measurability of `V n t` at each
**deterministic** `t`, which the `adapted_bracket` field of `ThresholdArrayInputs` already gives:

almost sure at fixed `t` → in probability at fixed `t` (`tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_ae`,
finite measure) → uniform in probability on `[0,T]`
(`BracketLLNUniform.tendsto_measure_exists_gt_of_tendsto_pointwise`, monotonicity, no
measurability).

## Contents

* `tendsto_measure_gt_of_ae_tendsto` — convergence in probability at a fixed time, in the
  strict-inequality shape the `ucp` field uses.
* `tendsto_measure_exists_gt_of_ae_tendsto` — **the bridge**, in exactly the shape of the `ucp`
  field.

Nothing here is about the reflected walk, and nothing here certifies the bracket law of large
numbers in any form.

/-- **The time reparametrisation, with no side condition.**  `Real.toNNReal (t / e²) = e⁻¹² · t`
for all `e t : ℝ≥0`.

At `e = 0` both sides are `0`: in `ℝ` division by zero is zero, and in `ℝ≥0` the inverse of `0`
is `0`.  So the real-scale form `Real.toNNReal (t / e ^ 2)` used by the almost-sure bracket
limit and the nonnegative-scale form `e⁻¹ ^ 2 * t` used by `RescaledBracketLLN` agree
everywhere, and the identity never needs the eventual positivity of the scale sequence. -/

/-! ## `RescaledBracketLLN` from the almost-sure form -/

/-- **`RescaledBracketLLN` from the almost-sure real-scale limit at each fixed time.**

`hmeas` is fixed-time measurability of the bracket (an `AEStronglyMeasurable` at each
deterministic time, which the `adapted_bracket` field of the array lane already supplies), and
`hae` is the almost-sure convergence along the **real** scale filter `𝓝[>] 0` at each fixed
time.  Only a finite measure is needed.

The proof is the reparametrisation and nothing else: compose the real-scale limit with the
coerced scale sequence (`tendsto_coe_nhdsWithin`), rewrite the time argument
(`toNNReal_div_sq`), and turn almost-sure convergence into convergence in probability with
`BracketLLNAlmostSureBridge.tendsto_measure_gt_of_ae_tendsto`. -/

From the almost-sure fixed-time limit of each of the four matrix entries, with limiting matrix
`Σ`, the directional bracket `∑ᵢⱼ ηᵢ Bᵢⱼ ηⱼ` has the limit `bilinForm Σ η η` — the constant the
CLT asks for.  The combination is a four-term finite sum, so it is done at the pointwise layer
where it costs one `tendsto_finset_sum`; doing it after passing to measures of bad events would
instead cost a union bound. -/
