# The bracket law of large numbers as a directional time average

`ReflectedGMS/Limit/ActualArrayBracketLimit.lean` reduces `p:lem:bracketlimit` for the
actual array of `Φ(Y)` to the single open hypothesis

```
hLLN : ∀ᵐ ω ∂P, ∀ i j : Fin 2,
  Tendsto (fun T : ℝ => ordinaryEdgeBracket cells Φ X i j (Real.toNNReal T) ω / T) atTop
    (𝓝 (Sigma i j))
```

which — by `MartingaleLimit.tendsto_ordinaryEdgeBracket_div_iff` — *is* the Birkhoff time
average `T⁻¹ ∫₀ᵀ Γ(Y_s)_{ij} ds → Σ_{ij}`.  This module builds the bridge from the
temporal-ergodic front to `hLLN` in two steps, both of which are steps of the manuscript's
own proof.

## 1. Polarization (tex:1574, "polarize to obtain the cross terms")

* the entries `Γ_{ij}` are **not** of one sign, so the transfer step of the manuscript's
  temporal ergodic theorem `p:prop:timeergodic` (tex:1553-1562), which is carried out for a
  **nonnegative** functional, does not apply to them directly;
* the directional densities `s ↦ ξᵀ Γ(Y_s) ξ` *are* nonnegative at every state
  (`MartingaleLimit.stateBracketDensity_quadraticForm_nonneg`, reflection times included),
  and the transfer step applies to each of them;
* three directions suffice: `(1,0)`, `(0,1)` and `(1,1)`.

`tendsto_ordinaryEdgeBracket_div_of_directional` and its almost-sure form
`bracketLLN_of_directional` are this reduction, and
`canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_directional` is
`MartingaleLimit.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit` with `hLLN` discharged in favour of the
three directional inputs.

## 2. From block averages to the Cesàro average (tex:1553-1562)

The checked temporal corpus
(`ReflectedGMS.ConditionalTemporalAveraging.tendsto_setAverageReal_chain_ae`) converges
**block averages** `|J|⁻¹ ∫_J F(θ_t Ω) dt` along the dyadic chain, not the interval
averages `T⁻¹ ∫₀ᵀ`.  The manuscript closes that gap by a direct argument: an origin dyadic
block `J ⊇ [0,T]` with `|J| ≤ (1+δ)T` sandwiches the interval average between multiples of
the block average.  `setAvg` is exactly the block average
(`setAverageReal_eq_setAvg`), `directionalAverage_eq_setAvg` identifies the directional
time average with the block average over `(0,T]`, and

* `intervalAverage_le_ratio_mul_setAvg` is the pointwise sandwich;
* `eventually_intervalAverage_le` is the manuscript's upper bound, for a general
  nonnegative density and with no boundedness assumption;
* `eventually_le_intervalAverage` is the matching lower bound for a *bounded* nonnegative
  density, and `eventually_le_intervalAverage_mono` is the comparison by which the
  manuscript transports it from `f ⊓ K` to `f` (truncation, tex:1561);
* `tendsto_intervalAverage` squeezes the two bounds into the Cesàro limit;
* `tendsto_directionalAverage_of_bounds` is the same for `directionalAverage`, i.e. for
  exactly the three inputs of step 1.

## What is *not* proved here

The temporal ergodic theorem itself.  The single named atomic input left open is the
**block data** `hblk`: for every `δ > 0` and all large `T`, an origin dyadic block `J`
containing `(0,T]` of length at most `(1+δ)T` whose block average is within `δ` of the
limit.  In the manuscript this comes from the complete-chain convergence
`p:lem:timeconverge` — which is checked, as
`ConditionalTemporalAveraging.tendsto_setAverageReal_chain_ae` — together with the
strictly positive grid probability `p:eq:gridprob` and the identification of the limit as
`𝔼[Γ]`, i.e. `p:lem:regeninvariant` plus environment ergodicity.  None of that is done
here.

Nothing in this file certifies `p:prop:timeergodic`, `p:thm:areaclt` or either main
theorem; no ergodicity, no triviality of a tail σ-field and no time-shift invariance of any
law is assumed or asserted.

# `p:lem:bracketlimit` for the actual quenched array of `Φ(Y)`

This module states and proves, for the **actual** ordinary-edge bracket
`MartingaleIngredients.ordinaryEdgeBracket cells Φ X i j` of the manuscript's own
harmonic coordinate `Φ` along the reflected path `X`, the structural clauses of manuscript
Lemma `p:lem:bracketlimit` (`tex:1564`) that do not require the temporal ergodic theorem,
and it reduces the remaining clauses to a short list of named atomic inputs.

The distinction with `ReflectedGMS/Forms/ActualHarmonicBracketIdentification.lean` matters
and is the reason this module exists.  That module identifies the predictable covariation
of the **Fukushima martingale limits** `fullEnergyMartingaleLimit` with
`ordinaryEdgeBracket`; the coordinate-path identification
`fullEnergyMartingaleLimit … = Φ(Y_t) - Φ(Y_0)` was its residual #1, and until that
identification exists nothing there is literally a statement about `Φ(Y)`.  Everything
proved here is stated **directly** about `ordinaryEdgeBracket cells Φ X i j`, which is the
object that `MartingaleIngredients.HasOrdinaryEdgeBracket cells Φ P F X M` names as the
predictable bracket of the actual plane-valued martingale `M`, namely the regular spatial
extension of `Φ` along the area path in `InvarianceMainStatement.FixedStartConclusions`.
So residual #1 is *bypassed*, not assumed: no Fukushima object occurs in any statement
below, and `bracket_limit_of_hasOrdinaryEdgeBracket` consumes the actual `M` directly.

## What is proved unconditionally

* `tendstoUniformlyOn_Icc_zero_of_eventually_monotoneOn` — a Pólya-type theorem: a family
  of functions that is eventually monotone in the *variable* and converges pointwise to a
  continuous limit converges uniformly on `[0, b]`.  This is the manuscript's
  "monotonicity and a finite mesh in `t`".  Mathlib has no such statement: its
  `Mathlib/Topology/UniformSpace/Dini.lean` assumes monotonicity in the *index*, which is a
  different hypothesis and does not apply to a rescaled bracket family.
* `tendstoUniformlyOn_diffusiveScaling_of_monotoneOn` — the diffusive rescaling: for a
  monotone `A` with `A 0 = 0` and `A T / T → σ`, the parabolically rescaled family
  `t ↦ ε² A (t / ε²)` converges to `t ↦ t σ` uniformly on every `[0, b]` as `ε ↓ 0`.
  Applied to a bracket this is exactly the passage from `p:eq:bracketLLN` to the
  manuscript's "brackets of `M^ε` converge to `tΣ` uniformly on compact time intervals".
* `stateBracketDensity_quadraticForm_nonneg` — the manuscript's `Γ` is pointwise positive
  semidefinite on the compactified state type, with the `1_{Y_r ∈ V}` convention (`0` at
  every collapsed end state) included.  The vertex-level statement underneath it is
  **reused**, not reproved: it is
  `DirectionalNondegeneracy.quadraticForm_bracketDensity_nonneg`.
* `monotoneOn_directional_ordinaryEdgeBracket` — consequently every directional form
  `t ↦ ξᵀ ⟨M⟩_t ξ` of the actual bracket is nondecreasing.  Off-diagonal *entries* are not
  monotone; this is precisely why the manuscript polarizes.
* `array_bracket_limit` — the abstract two-dimensional statement: symmetry and positive
  semidefiniteness of `Σ`, and the entrywise locally uniform diffusive limit, from the
  entrywise law of large numbers plus directional monotonicity.
* `quenched_ordinaryEdgeBracket_bracket_limit` and
  `bracket_limit_of_hasOrdinaryEdgeBracket` — the same for the actual quenched array.
* `symmetricPositiveDefinite_of_quadraticForm_ne_zero` — `Σ` is symmetric **positive
  definite** once the single atomic nondegeneracy input `hnull` is supplied.
* `canonicalBracket_bracket_limit` — the same at the **canonical shape of the main
  theorem**: the decoded environment `Code.decode e`, the manuscript coordinate `Φ.at e`,
  the exponential area-clock path `AreaClocks.exponentialAreaPath (decode e) D`, the
  completed filtration `InvarianceMainStatement.areaFiltration e D P`, and the bracket
  predicate `InvarianceMainStatement.CanonicalBracket e D Φ P M` that is verbatim the
  `hbracket` input of `InvarianceAssembly.reflectedInvarianceConclusions_of_named_inputs`.
  At this shape the environment geometry is **not** an input: it is `Code.decode_geometry`,
  which is unconditional.  `hLLN` is the only hypothesis left.
* `eq_inl_of_collapse_eq_some`, `spatialExtension_eq_of_collapse` and
  `phi_bracket_limit_of_canonicalBracket` — the statement **for `Φ(Y)` itself**.  The two
  pathwise clauses of `InvarianceAssembly.PathwiseClockClauses` that relate the lifted path
  to the area path and `M` to `Φ` (`collapse (Xexp t ω) = Y t ω` and
  `RegularSpatialExtension (decode e) (Φ.at e) (Xexp · ω) (M · ω)`) give
  `M t ω = Φ.at e v` at every time with `Y t ω = some v`; the conclusion therefore asserts,
  on one and the same almost-sure event, that the actual martingale *is* `Φ(Y)` at every
  ordinary time and that its rescaled brackets converge to `t Σ` locally uniformly.
* `tendsto_ordinaryEdgeBracket_div_iff` — the open input `hLLN` written in the
  manuscript's own form: the Birkhoff time average `T⁻¹ ∫₀ᵀ Γ(Y_s) ds` of the bracket
  density along the path.
* `canonicalBracket_of_parts` — the producer side, recorded here because it is what makes
  the hypothesis `hM` of the two theorems above reachable: `CanonicalBracket` from its
  three clauses with the **predictability clause discharged**, from
  `PredictableCompletionModification.isStronglyPredictable_ordinaryEdgeBracket_exponentialAreaPath`
  (checked, and carrying neither a joint-measurability nor a filtration-domination side
  hypothesis).  What is left to the caller is only the local-square-integrable martingale
  property, the pathwise càdlàg/integrability clause, the pathwise
  `A_0 = 0` / continuity / bounded-variation clause, and the compensated local-martingale
  clause — plus the manuscript's own data (reflected walk for the area clock, connected
  graph, positive summable cell areas, finite-energy coordinates).

## THIS IS AN HONESTLY CONDITIONAL RESULT

Every theorem below whose name mentions a bracket limit carries its open inputs as
**explicit named hypotheses**.  Nothing here certifies those inputs, and nothing here
certifies `p:thm:areaclt`, the `hlimit` input of
`InvarianceAssembly.reflectedInvarianceConclusions_of_named_inputs`, or either main
theorem.  The named open inputs are:

1. `hLLN` — `p:eq:bracketLLN`: `T⁻¹ ⟨M^i, M^j⟩_T → Σ_{ij}` quenched almost surely.  The
   manuscript obtains it from `p:prop:timeergodic` applied to each entry of `Γ` together
   with `p:thm:martingale`.  That is the temporal-homogenization front and is owned
   elsewhere.
2. `hint` — interval integrability of each bracket density along the path.  This is
   *verbatim* the second clause of `MartingaleIngredients.HasOrdinaryEdgeBracket`, so any
   producer of that predicate supplies it; `bracket_limit_of_hasOrdinaryEdgeBracket`
   consumes it in that form rather than as a separate assumption, so it is an open input
   of `quenched_ordinaryEdgeBracket_bracket_limit` only.
3. `hnull` — no nonzero deterministic null vector for `Σ`.  This is exactly the content of
   the manuscript's positive-definiteness paragraph (zero-specific-energy detection in
   `s:lem:localcontrol`, connectedness, and the corrector bound).  It is *not* proved here,
   and it is an open input of `symmetricPositiveDefinite_of_quadraticForm_ne_zero` only.

`hcells : Geometry cells` is **not** an open input: it is the environment's own geometry,
a hypothesis carried by the main theorem.  An earlier draft of this module instead assumed
summability of the squared-increment rows of `Φ`; that assumption has been discharged from
`Geometry` via the reused `DirectionalNondegeneracy` lemma and is gone.

So the only genuinely open mathematical input of
`bracket_limit_of_hasOrdinaryEdgeBracket`, the theorem a consumer would use, is `hLLN`.

Nothing in this file assumes tightness, a Lindeberg condition, a Brownian identification,
the localizer/exit producer, or the corrector/interpolation transfer of `tex:1648`–`1652`.

/-! ### The three inputs are already in the manuscript's time-average form

`MartingaleLimit.tendsto_ordinaryEdgeBracket_div_iff` records that `hLLN` is literally the
Birkhoff time average of `Γ`.  The directional inputs above are already stated as time
averages, so a producer working on the temporal-ergodic front never has to convert. -/

/-- The integrand of the directional average is nonnegative at every state, reflection
times included.  This is what makes the transfer step of `p:prop:timeergodic` applicable
to it, and it is what fails for the individual entries `Γ_{ij}`. -/

/-! ## From the manuscript's block averages to the Cesàro average

This section is the transfer step of `p:prop:timeergodic` (tex:1553-1562), stated for a
general nonnegative locally integrable density on the time axis.  It is purely
deterministic: the probabilistic production of the blocks `J` (the independent uniform
dyadic grid and the constant `p_δ` of `p:eq:gridprob`) is *not* carried out here; it enters
as the hypothesis `hblk`. -/

/-- `|J|⁻¹ ∫_J f`.  With `f t = F (θ t ω)` this is exactly
`ReflectedGMS.ConditionalTemporalAveraging.setAverageReal θ J F ω`, the object whose
convergence along the manuscript's dyadic chain is the checked
`ConditionalTemporalAveraging.tendsto_setAverageReal_chain_ae`. -/
