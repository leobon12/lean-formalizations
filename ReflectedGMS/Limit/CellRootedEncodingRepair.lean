# The cell-rooted encoding removes the origin-rooted transport obstruction (core check)

`Limit/OriginRootedTransportObstruction.ae_rootedAt_reRootFlow_of_transport` shows that the
degree `-2` transport field at an ORIGIN-rooted law forces the re-rooting flow to keep the origin
in the walker's current cell for a.e. early time; at the bridge kernel and a translation-covariant
representative this is a lattice condition, false at non-lattice laws.

The manuscript (tex:1350, `p:lem:timeMTP`) states the temporal transport for the CELL-rooted
encoding: "we forget the absolute spatial origin and retain the distinguished current cell".  This
module checks the pointwise core of that repair (repair R2):

* `InteriorOffMask z`: a representative field whose values are interior points of their cells off
  the boundary mask.  Such points exist in every cell of every environment
  (`exists_interiorOffMask_point`), so the predicate is satisfiable by a (non-measurable) choice;
  the measurable, similarity-covariant witness is the incenter packet.
* `cellRoot ω := rootMap (fun _ => 0) ω`: the cell-rooted encoding of a configuration — the frame
  in which the walker's time-`0` position sits at the origin.  It intertwines the re-rooting flow
  with the PLAIN time shift (`reRootFlow_cellRoot`) and commutes with the scaling
  (`reScale_cellRoot`), and it is measurable.
* `rootedAt_reFrame_iff`: rootedness after a frame change reads `rootAt` at the new origin.
* **`rootedAt_reRootFlow_cellRoot_of_coupled`** (the statement that makes the obstruction
  disappear): at the cell-rooted encoding of a configuration coupled to an interior-off-mask
  representative, the flowed configuration is rooted at EVERY rational vertex time — the necessary
  condition of the obstruction theorem holds identically, not merely a.e., and for every
  environment law.  `displacement_mem_currentCell_cellRoot` is the geometric form.
* `ae_rootedAt_reRootFlow_cellRoot_flowKernel` / `ae_rootedAt_reRootFlow_cellRootedLaw`: the
  same at the bridge kernel `κF` and at the pushed-forward cell-rooted law
  `(ν ⊗ₘ κF).map cellRoot`, for an interior-off-mask `CellField`.

Nothing here constructs the covariant representative, certifies the transport field at the
cell-rooted law, `p:lem:timeMTP`, or either main theorem.
