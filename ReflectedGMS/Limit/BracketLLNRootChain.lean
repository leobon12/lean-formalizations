# The bracket law of large numbers along the root dyadic chain

`Limit/RootBlockGridProbability.lean` discharged the `grid` field of
`GridBlockTransfer.GridChainData` for the root dyadic time blocks
`rootTimeBlock D k = [o_k, o_k + σ_k)`, and `Limit/GridChainTailConstant.lean` produced the
`chain` field from the checked temporal block machinery plus the single identification input
`TailAverageIdentification.GridAveragedConstant`.  This module composes the two, and in doing
so records an obstruction in the existing composition.

## 1. An obstruction: the frozen negative-time density makes `hdata` unsatisfiable

The root blocks are **two-sided**: the origin sits at the uniform relative position
`u_k = -o_k/σ_k ∈ [0,1)` of its level-`k` block, so a fraction `u_k` of every root block lies at
negative times.  The canonical densities of
`RootBlockGridProbability.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_rootBlockData` and
`GridBlockTransfer.canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_blockData` are read off the **one-sided**
path through `Real.toNNReal`, so at negative times they are frozen at the starting state.

* `eq_of_rootBlockDensity_of_frozen` — if a density is constant `c` on `(-∞,0]`, satisfies
  `RootBlockDensity ν f μ` for a uniform grid law, and has forward Cesàro limit `μ`, then
  `c = μ`.  Proof: with probability at least `(1/4)²` (a lower bound from the level-`k`
  cylinder law alone, uniformly in `k`) the origin sits in the window `u_k ∈ [1/2,3/4]` at
  infinitely many levels; at such a level the block average is `u_k c + (1-u_k)·(forward
  average)`, which stays `u_k|c-μ| ≥ |c-μ|/2` away from `μ`.
* `eq_of_hasRootBlockData_of_frozen` — the same for `HasRootBlockData`, which itself implies
  the forward Cesàro limit.
* `dirForm_bracketDensity_start_eq_of_rootBlockData` — **at the canonical data**: the `hdata`
  hypothesis of `canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_rootBlockData` forces
  `ξᵀ Γ(start) ξ = ξᵀ Σ ξ` in the three polarization directions, i.e. the bracket density of
  the *starting cell* already equals the limit.  Since the main theorem runs this over every
  start slot with `Σ = meanCovariance`, that `hdata` can only hold for environments with a
  constant bracket density; for a generic environment it is false.  Do not route through it.

## 2. The repair: extend the forward density by a backward trajectory

The transfer step only reads the density on `[0,T]`.  So the chain data may be supplied for
**any** extension of the forward density to negative times — in the manuscript, the backward
half of the two-sided trajectory (tex:1345, "its forward and time-reversed backward halves are
independent copies").

* `tendsto_intervalAverage_of_hasBlockData_of_eqOn` and the root-block form
  `tendsto_intervalAverage_of_hasRootBlockData_of_eqOn`.
* `canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_extendedRootBlockData` — `p:lem:bracketlimit` for the
  actual quenched array of `Φ(Y)` from `hdata` in the form *"almost surely there is an
  extension of the forward directional density with `HasRootBlockData`"*.
* `canonicalBracket_bracket_limit_of_twoSidedRootBlockData` — the same with the extension read
  off an independent backward sample `P ⊗ P'`, which is how the manuscript's two-sided law
  supplies it.

## 3. The chain field of the root blocks from `GridAveragedConstant`

`RootChainSystem` bundles the checked temporal block machinery's hypotheses for a system whose
complete ancestor chain is the actual root dyadic chain, and `UnmarkedRootDensity` the
unmarked functional and its density along the flow.

* `chain_rootTimeBlock_of_nat` — the `ℕ`-indexed conclusion of
  `GridChainTailConstant.ae_ae_chain_of_gridAveragedConstant` is the `ℤ`-indexed `chain` field
  of `RootBlockDensity` (negative levels are shorter than `1` and are excluded by the
  threshold).
* `ae_rootBlockDensity_of_gridAveragedConstant`,
  `ae_hasRootBlockData_of_gridAveragedConstant` (with the manuscript's truncations
  `F ∧ m`, `m : ℕ`, tex:1558) and `ae_tendsto_intervalAverage_of_gridAveragedConstant` —
  `p:prop:timeergodic` (forward half) for the root chain system, from `GridAveragedConstant`
  for `F` and its truncations.
* `ae_forall_dirVec_hasRootBlockData_of_gridAveragedConstant` — the three polarization
  directions at once, in the shape of the `hdata` of §2.

## What is *not* proved here

* `GridAveragedConstant` (`p:lem:regeninvariant` plus environment ergodicity).
* The construction of a `RootChainSystem` for the actual process: the annealed two-sided
  rooted law, the `κ`-selected block family on it, the root-chain selection, and the flow
  invariance `RootChainSystem.flowInvariant`.  That last field is inherited verbatim from the
  checked `ConditionalTemporalAveraging` (`hθP`) and is **stronger than the manuscript**, which
  only uses the degree `-2` temporal mass transport (tex:1360-1397) and therefore controls only
  scale-invariant tests.
* The annealed-to-quenched step of the manuscript (tex:1574, "Fubini gives the quenched
  almost-sure assertion") connecting §3 to the `hdata` of §2 at a fixed environment.

Nothing here certifies `p:lem:timeconverge`, `p:lem:regeninvariant`, `p:prop:timeergodic`,
`p:lem:bracketlimit`, `p:thm:areaclt` or either main theorem.

# The `chain` field of `GridChainData`, from the tail-constant identification

`ReflectedGMS/Limit/GridBlockTransfer.lean` reduces the bracket law of large numbers for the
actual quenched array of `Φ(Y)` to the two probabilistic fields of
`ReflectedGMS.GridBlockTransfer.GridChainData`.  Its `chain` field reads, verbatim,

```
chain : ∀ᵐ Dg ∂ν, ∀ η : ℝ, 0 < η → ∃ R : ℝ, ∀ k : ι,
  ENNReal.ofReal R ≤ volume (blk Dg k) → |setAvg (blk Dg k) f - μ| ≤ η
```

— for `ν`-almost every grid, every root block long enough has block average within `η` of the
constant `μ`.  Its author split it into two halves:

* the **convergence** half, which is the already checked
  `ConditionalTemporalAveraging.tendsto_setAverageReal_chain_ae`, read in length-indexed
  rather than chain-indexed form;
* the **identification** half, that the tail conditional expectation which that theorem
  produces as the limit is the constant `𝔼[F]` (in the application `𝔼[Γ]`).

This module carries out the first half and reduces the second to the single named input
`ReflectedGMS.TailAverageIdentification.GridAveragedConstant`, which is verbatim what
`p:lem:regeninvariant` together with environment ergodicity delivers in the manuscript
(tex:1526-1528).  The remaining measure-theoretic content of the identification —
the manuscript's steps `𝔼[Fψ(L)] = 𝔼[F]𝔼[ψ(L)]`, `𝔼[Fψ(L)] = 𝔼[Lψ(L)]` and the sign test —
is proved in `ReflectedGMS/Temporal/TailAverageIdentification.lean`.

## What is proved

* `ae_ae_forall_long_block` — the shape transfer.  A sequential limit along the ancestor
  chain, holding for `(P ⊗ ν)`-almost every (trajectory, grid) pair, becomes: for
  `P`-almost every trajectory, for `ν`-almost every grid, every block longer than a
  threshold has average within `η` of the limit.  This is the `chain` field's own shape,
  with `ι = ℕ`.
* `ae_ae_chain_of_gridAveragedConstant` — the full assembly: the `chain` field of
  `GridChainData`, for the density of one unmarked functional `F₀` along the flow, with
  `μ = 𝔼_P[F₀]`, from
  - the checked temporal block machinery (`TemporalBlockSystem`, its nesting, the flow
    invariance of the law, and the ancestor-chain selection data), and
  - the single named input `GridAveragedConstant`.

The quantifier `∀ᵐ ω ∂P` in front is the manuscript's quenched reading: the density `f` of
`GridChainData` is the bracket density along one fixed trajectory, and the grid is the only
remaining source of randomness.

## What is *not* proved

`GridAveragedConstant`.  In the manuscript it is `p:lem:regeninvariant` plus the
environment-ergodicity hypothesis; `p:lem:regeninvariant`'s own open inputs are reversal
invariance of the complete stopped return-cycle law, the size-biased entrance/age
decomposition of the cycle law, and the `v`-independence step.  None of that is touched
here, and nothing in this file certifies `p:lem:regeninvariant`, `p:prop:timeergodic`,
`p:lem:bracketlimit`, `p:thm:areaclt` or either main theorem.
