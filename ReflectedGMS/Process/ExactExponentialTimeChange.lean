# `hexact`: the exact-holding area path is a time change of the exponential one

`AreaClocks.exactAreaPath F D t ω` and `AreaClocks.exponentialAreaPath F D t ω`
are the *same* constructed process `Existence.process D (areaRate F)` on the
*same* coupled chain `ω.1`, evaluated at two holding families: the unit family
`fun _ => 1` and the sample's own exponential family `ω.2`.  So
`Process/HoldingTimeChange.lean` applies verbatim, and clause (8) of
`InvarianceAssembly.PathwiseClockClauses` — the `hexact` input of
`PathwiseClockClauseLift.ae_hlift_of_atomic_inputs` — follows from (3.16) for
each of the two families.

* For the exponential family (3.16) is the project's existing residual
  `EnvironmentWalkDataProducer.AreaClockReachesLevelZeroIndices`, through the
  checked `EnvironmentWalkDataProducer.areaClock_holdingTimesSummable`.
* For the unit family the **divergence** half is unconditional
  (`ae_tsum_holding_one_addr_zero_eq_top`): the level-`0` chain returns to its
  starting cell infinitely often, and each such visit contributes the same
  positive exact holding length `a_z / π(z)`.  The **finiteness** half is the
  named input `ExactAreaClockReachesLevelZeroIndices`, the exact-holding twin of
  the exponential residual.

## Why the twin is a genuine new input

`AreaClockReachesLevelZeroIndices` says `∑_{ξ < [(0,K)]} E_ξ a_{Y_ξ}/π(Y_ξ) < ∞`;
its twin says `∑_{ξ < [(0,K)]} a_{Y_ξ}/π(Y_ξ) < ∞`.  Conditionally on the chain
these are almost surely equivalent, because for independent unit exponentials
`E_ξ` one has `∑ c_ξ E_ξ < ∞` a.s. iff `∑ c_ξ < ∞` (the Laplace transform
`∏ (1+c_ξ)⁻¹` is positive iff `∑ c_ξ < ∞`).  But that equivalence is a
probabilistic producer — it is *not* a deterministic consequence, and it is not
proved here: nothing in this file certifies either residual.
