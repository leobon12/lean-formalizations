# The area time-changed holding rate and neighbour law

Manuscript theorem `p:thm:areaclock` ends with the sentence

> Thus `X_t = Y_{A^{-1}(t)}`, `t ≥ 0`, is defined for all times.  It preserves the
> ordered reflected path and every end label.  **At a vertex `H`, its holding time
> is exponential with mean `a_H/π(H)` and its departing neighbour has
> probabilities `c(H,H')/π(H)`.**

The homeomorphism clause is already checked
(`AreaClockContinuity.ae_exists_homeomorph_areaClock`); a homeomorphism alone is
not the process law.  This file proves the highlighted clause for the *actual*
time-changed path, by the manuscript's own argument:

> Each holding interval at `o` is multiplied in length by `a_o/m_0(o)`.  The
> resulting lengths are independent exponentials of mean `a_o/π(o) > 0` …  On any
> other vertex holding interval the same deterministic multiplication gives the
> stated law, without changing the next-vertex choice.

## What is actually done

Along one genuine per-vertex sojourn — the interval `[0, τ)` on which the actual
reflected path of `ProcessFamily.X` sits at its starting vertex `o`, `τ` being
`Theorem16.exitTime` — the area clock `A(s) = ∫₀ˢ a_{Y_u}/m(Y_u) du` is *exactly*
the linear map `s ↦ (a_o/m(o)) · s` (`areaClock_eq_mul_of_forall_lt`).  Hence the
inverse clock rescales the sojourn by the deterministic factor `a_o/m(o)` and
leaves the embedded chain untouched:

* `exitTime_timeChanged` : the exit time of the time-changed path is the image of
  the fast exit time under the clock, `WithTop.map`-wise;
* `stoppedValue_timeChanged` : the position at that exit time is **unchanged**,
  which is the "without changing the next-vertex choice" clause;
* `exponentialFirstStep_areaTimeChangedPath` : the full property-(iii) package
  `Theorem16.ExponentialFirstStep` for the area time-changed path
  `areaTimeChangedPath` at rate `AreaClocks.areaRate F = π/a`.  Its exit time is
  `Exponential(π(o)/a_o)`, i.e. has mean `a_o/π(o)`, it is independent of the
  departing vertex, and that vertex has law `c(o,·)/π(o)`.

No finite total area is used, no global chronological CTRW is built, and the
exponential holding law is not re-derived: it is the existing property (iii) of
`IsReflectedWalk` for the fast rate `π/m`, transported along the clock.  The
non-vertex and reflection times are preserved because the time change is the
pathwise inverse homeomorphism of the *same* trajectory: `areaTimeChangedPath`
reads `PF.X` at a rescaled time and never modifies the path itself.

The inverse clock is the canonical right-continuous inverse
`A⁻¹(t) = inf{s : t ≤ A(s)}` (`inverseAreaClock`); on the almost sure event where
`A` is a homeomorphism it is its inverse (`inverseAreaClock_eq_symm`), so no
measurable selection of the homeomorphism is required.
