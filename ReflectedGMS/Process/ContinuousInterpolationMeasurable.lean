# Evaluation-measurability of the continuous interpolation

The interpolation of `Process/ContinuousInterpolation` is defined pathwise, through a choice of
holding interval and a choice of càdlàg extension.  This file shows that it is nevertheless a
measurable function of the sample at every fixed time, by exhibiting it as a pointwise limit of
explicit measurable **dyadic approximations** (`approx`):

* the exit time of the sojourn through `r` is approximated by the first level-`n` dyadic time
  after `r` at which the path differs from its value at `r` (`exitIndex`, a hitting index over
  countably many measurable events);
* the entry time by the last level-`n` dyadic time before `r` with a different value
  (`entryTime`, a countable supremum);
* the following vertex by the value of the path at the approximate exit time.

`tendsto_approx` proves the convergence at every time, pathwise, from `PathInputs` alone: right
regularity and density of vertex times put level-`n` dyadic times inside every right
neighbourhood of the exit time, and inside every right neighbourhood of a time just before the
entry time; at end-valued times the approximation is the extension at the approximate exit
times, which converge to `r` from the right.

`exists_measurable_interpolation` then produces, from `PathInputs` almost surely, a map into
`C(ℝ≥0, Plane)` with measurable evaluations that is almost surely the interpolation: off a
measurable null set containing every bad sample it is set to `0`.

Nothing here is specific to the reflected walk beyond the measurability of each `X t`.
