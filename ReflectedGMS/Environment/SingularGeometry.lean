# Face configurations with a singular set

This file states **Definition 1.1** of the singular-set manuscript ("An invariance principle for
reflected random walks with spatial singularities"), which generalises the covering hypothesis of
`ReflectedGMS.Geometry`.

The manuscript's Definition 1.1 imposes:

* (i) every cell has nonempty interior and Lebesgue-null boundary, and distinct cells have disjoint
  interiors (cells are compact and connected by the ambient `IndexedCells` conventions);
* (ii) there is a **closed** set `Ssing` with `H¹(Ssing) = 0` such that `ℂ \ Ssing ⊆ ⋃ H`, and every
  point of `ℂ \ Ssing` has a neighbourhood meeting only finitely many cells.  No covering assumption
  is imposed at points of `Ssing`;
* (iii) the cell adjacency graph is connected and locally finite; adjacent cells are distinct and
  intersect, with finite strictly positive symmetric conductances;
* (iv) there is a **countable** set `V* ⊆ ℂ` such that whenever `z ∉ Ssing ∪ V*` lies in two distinct
  cells, those cells are adjacent.

The manuscript is explicit (page 2) that `Ssing` and `V*` are *geometric witnesses*: they are
existentially quantified and used pathwise, and they are **not** additional random marks — only the
cell configuration and its conductances are re-rooted in the mass-transport assumption.  That is why
`SingularWitness` is bundled under `Nonempty` in `GeometrySingular` rather than carried as data on
the environment.

The two structural clauses (i) and (iii) are shared verbatim with `ReflectedGMS.Geometry`; only the
covering clause differs, and (ii)'s local finiteness and (iv) are new.

**Fidelity note on (iv).** The manuscript says "whenever `z ∉ Ssing ∪ V*` and `z ∈ H ∩ K` for
*distinct cells*, `H ∼ K`", whereas `face` below quantifies over distinct *labels* `v ≠ w`.  These
agree: clause (i) makes the interiors of distinct labels disjoint and every cell's interior nonempty,
so two distinct labels cannot carry the same cell.  The Lean clause is therefore neither weaker nor
stronger than the manuscript's.

Clauses (i) and (iii) are exactly those of `ReflectedGMS.Geometry`; the covering clause
`(⋃ v, cell v) = Set.univ` of `Geometry` is replaced by the existence of a `SingularWitness`, which
carries the weaker covering statement together with (ii)'s local finiteness and (iv). -/
