# Definition 1.1 and (LCS) of the general-cell singular-set manuscript

Manuscript: "Reflected scale-free invariance principle — cell configurations with singularities"
(`work/general/manuscript.pdf`, text in `work/general/manuscript-text.txt`, lines 53–80).

**Definition 1.1 (Cell configurations with a singular set).**  A countably infinite collection of
compact connected subsets of `ℂ`, an adjacency relation `∼` and conductances `c`, such that

* (i) each cell has nonempty interior, and `Area(H ∩ K) = 0` for distinct cells;
* (ii) there is a closed set `Ssing` with `H¹(Ssing) = 0` and `ℂ \ Ssing ⊆ ⋃ H`, and every
  `z ∉ Ssing` has a neighbourhood meeting only finitely many cells;
* (iii) `∼` is symmetric, `H ∼ K ⇒ H ≠ K ∧ H ∩ K ≠ ∅`, and `c(H,K) = c(K,H) ∈ (0,∞)` on adjacent
  pairs.

**(LCS).**  `H(L)` is connected for every horizontal or vertical compact segment `L ⊂ ℂ \ Ssing`,
with the **same** witness `Ssing` as in (ii).

What is deliberately **absent**, as in the manuscript: no face/incidence rule (intersecting cells
need not be adjacent), no exceptional vertex set `V*`, no assumed graph connectedness, and no assumed
graph local finiteness — the manuscript derives connectedness (Proposition 2.3) and local finiteness
(Lemma 2.5, from mass transport and (FE)).  Null boundaries and disjoint interiors are likewise
derived (Lemma 2.1).

Because graph local finiteness is not assumed, the conductance array cannot be packaged as a
`ReflectedWalk.ConductanceGraph` (whose rows must be summable).  `CellConfiguration` is therefore
the cells together with a symmetric, nonnegative, loop-free real array, with **no** summability.
Adjacency is positivity of the conductance, exactly as for `ConductanceGraph`; this encodes
(iii): symmetry is `c_symm`, `H ∼ K ⇒ H ≠ K` holds at the level of labels by `c_self` (and at the
level of cells because distinct labels carry distinct cells, by (i)), and adjacent pairs carry a
real, hence finite, strictly positive conductance.
