These are conclusion predicates; no measurable selection is assumed for the
pathwise quantification over representatives.  The every-representative conjunct is the
clause that excludes the zero (or constant) field: the zero field satisfies the centroid
conjunct's companions but fails sublinearity against arbitrary in-cell representatives
