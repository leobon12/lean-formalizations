# Corollary 21.1: with `Ssing = ∅` Definition 1.1 + (LCS) is exactly the GMS class

Manuscript: "Reflected scale-free invariance principle — cell configurations with singularities"
(`work/general/manuscript-text.txt`), Definition 1.1 and (LCS) at lines 53–80, **Corollary 21.1
(Recovery of GMS Theorem 1.16)** at lines 2446–2458.

The proof of Corollary 21.1 reads: *with `Ssing = ∅`, Definition 1.1 says that the cells cover `ℂ`,
are spatially locally finite, are compact and connected with nonempty interiors and pairwise
zero-area intersections, and carry an arbitrary symmetric adjacency relation between distinct
intersecting cells with finite positive symmetric conductances.  These are exactly the objects in
[GMS, Definition 1.15].  The condition (LCS) is now their connectedness-along-segments hypothesis,
with the same simultaneous quantifiers.*

This file formalizes that sentence at the level of a single cell configuration.

* `GMSGeometry C` — the deterministic hypotheses of GMS Theorem 1.16 (Definition 1.15 together with
  its segment condition), written out verbatim: connected compact cells (compactness is carried by
  `NonemptyCompacts`), nonempty interiors, pairwise Lebesgue-null intersections, **full** covering of
  the plane, spatial local finiteness (mathlib's `LocallyFinite` for the family of cells),
  adjacency ⇒ intersection, and `SegmentConnected` — `H(L)` connected for **every** horizontal or
  vertical compact segment `L`, with no avoidance condition.  Symmetry, loop-freeness and finite
  positive conductances are carried by `CellConfiguration` itself, exactly as for the general class.
* `generalGeometry_of_gmsGeometry` — every GMS configuration satisfies Definition 1.1 + (LCS), with
  the witness `Ssing = ∅` (`emptySingularSet`).
* `gmsGeometry_iff` — **Corollary 21.1, deterministic part**: `GMSGeometry C` holds **iff** `C`
  satisfies Definition 1.1 + (LCS) with a witness whose singular set is empty.  This is
  `GeneralGeometry C` clause for clause, with the singular-set clause strengthened by `S.sing = ∅`.
* `locallyFinite_cells_iff` — GMS phrase spatial local finiteness as "each compact set meets
  finitely many cells"; this is equivalent to the pointwise-neighbourhood form used here.
* `GMSGeometry.locallyFiniteGraph` — on the GMS class graph local finiteness is a consequence
  (neighbours of `H` meet the compact cell `H`), so GMS configurations are `IndexedCells`.
* `Code.ValidGMS`, `Code.validGeneral_of_validGMS` and
  `GeneralLaws.supportedOnValidGeneral_of_ae_validGMS` — the same inclusion at the level of codes
  and environment laws: a law carried by GMS codes is carried by general codes, so the main theorems
  of the general manuscript apply to it (the "include" half of Corollary 21.1).

The probabilistic half of Corollary 21.1 (recurrence of the ordinary walk, identification of the
reflected path with the ordinary path) is not part of this file.
