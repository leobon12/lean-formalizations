# Generic lines and finite boundaries

This file proves **Proposition 2.1** of the singular-set manuscript: under Definition 1.1
(`ReflectedGMS.GeometrySingular`) there are Lebesgue-null exceptional sets `Nh, Nv ⊆ ℝ` such that
for every offset outside them, *every* nondegenerate closed segment at that offset is met by only
finitely many cells and the induced subgraph on those cells is connected.

The two null sets are produced **once and for all**, so that the conclusion holds simultaneously for
every pair of segment endpoints; this is exactly the quantifier order that
`ReflectedGMS.AELineConnected` and the whole AE-LC corpus use.

The main consequences are:

* `ReflectedGMS.exists_null_sets_segment_finite_and_reachable` — Proposition 2.1 with explicit null
  sets, carrying both the finiteness and the connectivity half (the finiteness half is what
  Corollary 2.2 on good spatial rectangles consumes);
* `ReflectedGMS.aeLineConnected_of_geometrySingular` — the derived `AELineConnected F`, which is the
  hypothesis that `ReflectedGMS.Code.Valid` takes as an input.

The mathematical content is isolated in
`ReflectedGMS.finite_and_segmentReachable_of_isCompact_of_isPreconnected`, which is the honest
general statement: *any* compact preconnected subset of the plane avoiding `Ssing ∪ V*` meets
finitely many cells and induces a connected subgraph.  The horizontal and vertical halves of
Proposition 2.1 are two instances of it, and Corollary 2.2 will use the same lemma for the four
sides of a rectangle.

Proof of the general lemma, following the manuscript:

* the coordinate projections are `1`-Lipschitz, so `H¹(pᵢ(Ssing)) ≤ H¹(Ssing) = 0`, and on `ℝ`
  one-dimensional Hausdorff measure is Lebesgue measure; the projection of the countable set `V*` is
  countable, hence null as well;
* a segment at a good offset avoids `Ssing ∪ V*` entirely, so each of its points has a neighbourhood
  meeting finitely many cells, and compactness turns this into global finiteness;
* if the induced graph were disconnected, the reachability class of one vertex and its complement
  would split the segment into two nonempty disjoint relatively closed pieces — disjoint precisely
  because a shared point would lie outside `Ssing ∪ V*` in two distinct cells and hence force
  adjacency by Definition 1.1(iv).  That contradicts connectedness of a closed interval.

/-! ### Connectivity of the cells met by a connected set off `Ssing ∪ V*` -/

/-- The cells meeting a preconnected set that avoids `Ssing ∪ V*` induce a connected subgraph.

The proof is the manuscript's: were the induced graph disconnected, the reachability class of one
vertex and its complement would cut the set into two nonempty disjoint relatively closed pieces.
Closedness uses the finiteness supplied by `hfin`; disjointness uses Definition 1.1(iv), since a
common point would lie in two distinct cells outside `Ssing ∪ V*` and hence force adjacency. -/

/-- **Proposition 2.1 (Generic lines and finite boundaries).**  Under Definition 1.1 there are
Lebesgue-null sets `Nh, Nv ⊆ ℝ` such that for `y ∉ Nh` every horizontal segment `[a,b] × {y}` meets
finitely many cells and induces a connected subgraph, and symmetrically for `x ∉ Nv` and the
vertical segments `{x} × [a,b]`.

Both exceptional sets are produced once and work simultaneously for *all* segment endpoints, which
is what the AE-LC quantifier order requires and what Corollary 2.2 needs in order to control the
four sides of a rectangle at the same time. -/
