# Assembly of the harmonic-coordinate main theorem: a checked reduction

This module reduces the full harmonic-coordinate target
`HarmonicMainStatement.HarmonicCoordinateMainTheorem` — the conclusion
`HarmonicCoordinateConclusions (validLaw P hP)`, i.e. the existence of one measurable
unmarked `CellField` satisfying the seven clauses of `IsHarmonicCoordinate` — to a list of
**named, atomic open inputs**.  Every clause that the project's checked modules can already
discharge is discharged here; nothing below asserts that the main theorem is proved, and a
conditional reduction never certifies its inputs.

## The construction

The coordinate field is **not** an input.  It is built from the concrete block interpolants
`DyadicApproximation.phi` of the main statement, along a deterministic subsequence `ms`:

* `differenceApproximant ms j ω (Nat.pair a b) = φ_{ms j}(H_b) − φ_{ms j}(H_a)` is the marked
  *difference* approximant on paired labels (zero unless the environment lies in the good
  event `SublinearEvent` of sublinear diameter decay — where block interpolants are unique,
  so `phi` is canonical — and both labels are active);
* `markedDifferenceField ms` is its limit on the good set `LimitGood` where every paired label
  converges (`Corrector/MarkedLimitingCoordinateMeasurability`), and the zero field elsewhere;
* `unmarkedDifferenceField ms` is its descent to the environment alone through the grid
  average of the arctangent code (`Corrector/UnmarkedCoordinateDescent`, the measurability
  half of `s:prop:gridindependence`);
* `harmonicCellField ms hmeas` integrates the unmarked difference field from a canonical
  base label: the root cell when the origin is unmasked, and the least active label whose
  cell contains the origin otherwise.

Descending the *difference* field rather than the potential is what makes the covariance
clauses hold **exactly and everywhere**: the label transport `pairTransport` of a similarity is
linear and independent of the auxiliary grid, so `GridTransfer` holds in both directions and
`descentField_covariant` applies; a potential-level transport would depend on the grid at
masked roots.  Gradient covariance then needs only the cocycle identity of a difference field,
and normalized covariance uses that the base label of the translated environment is the
relabeled root (`ActualSpatialDensityBridge.rootAt_similarity`).

## What is discharged and what is open

Discharged from checked producers (see the clause table in the docstring of
`harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_named_inputs`): the vacuity guard (6) by
`DyadicCylinderLaw.uniformGridLaw_gridMeasure`; the reduction of "every uniform grid law" in
(7) to the constructed one by `DyadicGridLawUniqueness.eq_of_uniformGridLaw`; the boundary
mask clause of (5) by `Spatial.ae_notMem_boundaryMask_of_massTransport`; the full measure of
the good event by `Spatial.ae_maxDiamHittingBall_finite_and_sublinear` and its similarity
invariance by `sublinearDiameterDecay_of_similarity`; root normalization, everywhere, from
the construction; both covariance clauses (1)(2), everywhere, from the covariance of the
interpolants on the good event;
measurability (3) and finiteness (4) of the unmarked specific energy, the latter through the
quadratic bound of `Corrector/SpecificEnergyPolarization` applied to the concrete
approximants; the block-interpolant clause of (7) — including uniqueness of block
interpolants, proved here from `existsUnique_vector_trace_minimizer` — from the spatial
maximal bound; and the representative-independent half of the sublinearity clause from its
centroid half and `s:eq:DR`.

The spatial maximal bound itself is **no longer an input**: `s:prop:maximal` for the rooted
(FE) density is discharged from the manuscript's own `s:eq:MTP` and finite (FE) moment by
`Spatial/SpatialMaximalForFiniteEnergy` (see `spatialMaximalBound_of_massTransport`), so the
three final statements carry ten open inputs rather than eleven.

Open inputs are stated as named `def`s with the audited gap they belong to.  The inputs
`Marked*` are still stated at the level of the marked limit; they are the honest residue of
this milestone and are to be pushed down to the summable-patch-energy, block-exhaustion and
specific-energy-projection inputs of `Corrector/LimitingHarmonicPotential`,
`Corrector/LimitingPotentialFreeOrthogonality` and `Corrector/SpecificEnergyLocalControl`.

**This file proves no main theorem.**  Its final statements are implications whose
hypotheses are open; a conditional reduction certifies neither its inputs nor
`HarmonicCoordinateMainTheorem`.

# The measurable marked limiting harmonic coordinate

`Corrector/MeasurableInfinitePatchMinimizer.lean` produces, for each approximation stage, a
field of anchored energy minimizers whose value at every label is a **measurable** function
of the environment. `Corrector/LimitingHarmonicPotential.lean` produces, at a **fixed**
environment, an anchored pointwise limit of such approximants along graph paths, one real
coordinate at a time. Neither says anything about the limit as a function of the
environment: the pathwise producer constructs its limit by `limUnder` after an existence
argument that is run separately at every environment, so nothing in it is measurable, and
the manuscript's marked limit `Φ` has to be a single measurable object.

This file supplies exactly that missing joint step, for the marked environment space
`HarmonicMainStatement.MarkedEnvironment = Env × Grid` used by the main statement.

* `ConvergesAt A n` is the event that the approximants converge at the canonical cell label
  `n`; it is measurable (`measurableSet_convergesAt`) because `Plane` is Polish, via
  `MeasureTheory.measurableSet_exists_tendsto`.
* `LimitGood A` is the good set on which *every* label converges — the countable
  intersection of the previous events, hence measurable.
* `limitValue A` is the limit itself, with the **canonical zero fallback** off the
  convergence event of each label. It is jointly measurable into the countable label
  product (`measurable_limitValue`), it is the pointwise limit at every label of every
  environment at which that limit exists (`tendsto_limitValue`), and it is the *unique*
  field with those two properties (`eq_limitValue`).
* Because the limit is characterised by pointwise convergence and uniqueness of limits,
  **exact** covariance passes from the approximants to the limit with no extra hypothesis:
  `limitValue_normalizedCovariant` is the `NormalizedCovariant` shape
  `Φ(e')(relabel v) = s • (Φ(e) v − Φ(e) r)` and `limitValue_gradientCovariant` is the
  `GradientCovariant` shape, both of which the main statement demands. The good set is
  invariant under such a relation (`mem_limitGood_of_covariant`), so the covariance is not
  asserted on a set that the fallback could destroy.
* `convergesAt_of_coordinates` converts the *real* coordinatewise convergence supplied by
  the pathwise producer into the `Plane`-valued convergence event used here.
* `exists_measurable_marked_limiting_coordinate` is the packaged statement, and
  `cellFieldAtGrid` records how a marked field of this shape yields the
  `EnvironmentFields.CellField` demanded by `HarmonicCoordinateMainTheorem`.

## Scope

Nothing here proves that the concrete `DyadicApproximation.phi` approximants are measurable,
that they converge, or that the limit does not depend on the auxiliary dyadic grid. Those
are the separate producers (measurable block interpolation, the summable-gradient input of
`s:prop:limit`, and the unmarking by independent copies). This file is the joint
measurability/covariance step between them, and it assumes no covariance of the limit: only
covariance of the given approximants, from which covariance of the limit is *derived*.

/-! ### The good event of the construction

The concrete interpolant `phi` is a `Classical.choose` over block interpolants, and block
interpolants are unique exactly under sublinear diameter decay `s:eq:DR`
(`isBlockInterpolation_unique` below).  On an environment without that decay two
similarity-related choices need not correspond, so an *everywhere* covariance input for
`phi` would be undischargeable.  The construction is therefore switched off outside the event
`SublinearEvent`.  That event has full measure by the checked
`ae_maxDiamHittingBall_finite_and_sublinear`, and its similarity invariance is proved here
(`sublinearDiameterDecay_of_similarity`).  Its measurability is never needed on its own: the
construction only sees the event through the gated interpolant `gatedApproximant`, whose
measurability is the input `hmeas`. -/

/-! ### The marked-level inputs (the residue of this milestone)

Each of the following is stated for the marked potential `markedPotential ms`, i.e. for the
limit of the concrete difference approximants along `ms`.  They are the manuscript's
`s:prop:limit` conclusions and the centroid form of `s:eq:sublinear`; their intended producers
are the checked pathwise modules `Corrector/LimitingHarmonicPotential`,
`Corrector/LimitingPotentialFreeOrthogonality`, `Corrector/SpecificEnergyLocalControl`,
`Corrector/ResidualEnergyLineVariation`, `Corrector/GoodOffsetWindowAssembly` and
`Corrector/GoodGridMaximumPrinciple`, instantiated at the concrete approximants.  None of
them mentions the unmarked field `harmonicCellField`: the passage from the marked limit to
the environment-only coordinate is proved below from `DifferenceFieldGridIndependent`. -/

/-- OPEN INPUT (gap 1, `s:prop:limit`, pointwise convergence): almost surely every pairwise
difference of the concrete interpolants converges along `ms`. -/

sublinear against cell centroids.  The representative-independent half of the sublinearity

all for the marked law: the neighbourhood errors of clause (d), the specific energy of every

/-! ### Clauses (3) and (4): measurability and finiteness of the specific energy

The specific energy of the *unmarked* field is read off the marked law: the integrand depends
on the environment alone, the grid law has mass one, and on the marked law the unmarked field
agrees almost surely with the marked potential.  Finiteness then comes from the concrete
approximants through the quadratic bound `ρ_{θ+η} ≤ 2ρ_θ + 2ρ_η` of
`Corrector/SpecificEnergyPolarization`; no separate finite-energy input is taken. -/

/-- **Reduction of `HarmonicCoordinateConclusions` to named inputs.**

This is an implication, not a proof of the harmonic-coordinate theorem: the **ten**
hypotheses `hmeas`, `hcov`, `hcopies`, `hconv`, `hpatch`, `hharm`, `hsub`, `hdens`, `hnbr`
and `hspec` are open, and nothing in this file certifies any of them.  The
coordinate field is not an input: it is the concrete `harmonicCellField ms hmeas`, built
from the block interpolants `phi` of the main statement on the good event `SublinearEvent`.

The inputs are, in order:

* `hν`, `hFE` — the manuscript's own environment hypotheses (mass transport and the finite
  (FE) moment); at `ν = validLaw P hP` these are the main theorem's hypotheses, not open
  obligations.
* `ms`, `hms` — a deterministic strictly increasing subsequence, chosen once (a parameter of
  the construction, not a mathematical claim).
* `hmeas` — measurability of the concrete block interpolants at every label and stage, gated
  by the good event (`gatedApproximant`); its producer route is a measurable selection of
  block minimizers (`Corrector/MeasurableBlockMinimizer`), which agrees with `phi` on the
  good event by `isBlockInterpolation_unique`, together with measurability of that event.
* `hcov` — exact covariance of the gradients of the block interpolants under every physical
  similarity, for a measure-preserving action on uniform grids, on the good event (where
  block interpolants are unique, so `phi` is determined by its specification).
* `hcopies` — grid independence of the marked difference field, `s:prop:gridindependence`.
* `hconv` — almost-sure convergence of every pairwise difference of the interpolants along
  `ms`, `s:prop:limit`.
* `hpatch` — patch-energy convergence of the gradients along `ms`, `s:prop:limit`(d).
* `hharm` — full variational and discrete harmonicity of the marked limit,
  `s:prop:limit`(a) and `s:eq:freeorth`.
* `hsub` — centroid sublinearity of the marked limit, `s:eq:sublinear`.
* `hdens` — measurability of the concrete rooted densities and neighbourhood errors.
* `hnbr` — convergence in probability of the neighbourhood errors, `s:prop:limit`(d).
* `hspec` — finite expected specific energy of every stage and expected specific-energy
  convergence, `s:eq:limitnorm`.

Discharged outright from the checked corpus: the spatial maximal inequality
`s:prop:maximal` (`spatialMaximalBound_of_massTransport`, from `hν` and `hFE` alone); the
vacuity guard (6); the collapse of the `∀ σ` quantifier in (7); the boundary-mask clause of
(5); root normalization everywhere; both covariance clauses (1)(2) from `hcov`;
measurability (3) and finiteness (4) of the unmarked specific energy; the block-interpolant
clause of (7), including uniqueness; and the representative-independent half of the
sublinearity clause. -/
