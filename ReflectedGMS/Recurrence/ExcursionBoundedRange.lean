# Bounded spatial range of a single excursion

`Recurrence/CountableTargetExcursion.lean` proves, for an arbitrary target `S ⊆ VG` and an
arbitrary finite-energy competitor `f` with `f(o) = 0` and `f ≡ 1` on `S`,

  `P_o[ the walk visits S before returning to o ] ≤ E(f)/π(o)`,

the event being the pathwise `visitsTargetBeforeReturn`, which uses **no** hitting time of
`S` and no attainment.

The spatial consumer (manuscript `r:prop:criterion`) applies this to the complements of
**spatial** balls: `rho v` is the spatial radius of the vertex `v` (for cell
representatives `z`, `rho = fun v => ‖z v‖`), and the targets are

  `farTarget rho R = {v | R < rho v}`,

which are *not* graph-distance balls and for which no spatial local finiteness is assumed.
The hypothesis supplied by the annular log-cutoff estimates is that these targets admit
competitors of arbitrarily small energy (`VanishingFarEnergy`).

The conclusion proved here is the **one-excursion** half of the criterion: almost surely
the spatial radius is bounded along the whole first excursion away from `o`, i.e. along
every time `t` at or after the departure time `σ_o = exitTime 𝓧.X o` such that the path has
not returned to `o` anywhere on `[σ_o, t]` (`MemFirstExcursion`).

No Borel–Cantelli argument is needed: the unbounded-range event
`excursionRangeUnbounded` is *contained* in `visitsTargetBeforeReturn 𝓧 o (farTarget rho R)`
for **every** `R` simultaneously (it is the intersection of those events over all real `R`),
so its outer measure is bounded by every one of the vanishing energy ratios and is therefore
zero.  The intersection is uncountable, but only monotonicity of the measure is used, so no
measurability of the event is required anywhere.

What is **not** proved here: the extension from the first excursion to every excursion
completed before a fixed time `T`.  That extension is not a formal consequence of this
statement — it needs the successive return times to `o` to be almost surely finite and to
diverge (through their positive holding times), which is a genuine additional input; see the
module-final remark.

/-- **The vanishing-energy hypothesis.**  Arbitrarily small-energy competitors exist for the
complements of spatial balls: for every `ε > 0` there is a level `R` and a function `f` of
finite energy on the **full** finite-energy domain, vanishing at `o`, equal to `1` on all of
`{rho > R}`, with energy ratio `E(f)/π(o) < ε`.

This is the shape delivered by the annular logarithmic cutoff estimates; no decay, summable
speed, finite support, or finite-support closure is imposed on `f`. -/
