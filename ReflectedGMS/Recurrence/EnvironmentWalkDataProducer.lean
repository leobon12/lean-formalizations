# The `hdata` input of the reflected invariance assembly, reduced to one clock clause

`InvarianceAssembly.reflectedInvarianceConclusions_of_named_inputs` carries as its
input `hdata` the clause

> almost surely, the canonical construction is a reflected walk for both the area
> clock and the admissible fast clock,

i.e. `∀ᵐ e ∂ν, ∃ hnt, ∃ D hG, QuenchedFormulation.EnvironmentWalkData e D hG`.
This file discharges **every** part of that clause except one, and states the
remainder as a named clock property of the area clock.

## What is proved here, unconditionally

* `infinite_of_geometry` / `nontrivial_vertex` — a coded environment has infinitely
  many cells, hence `Nontrivial (Vertex e.val)`.  The cells are compact and cover a
  dense subset of the plane, which is not compact, so there cannot be finitely many of
  them.  This
  removes the `hnt` existential of `hdata` from the list of assumptions.
* `decode_connected` — the cell graph of *every* `e : Env` is connected; this is a
  field of `Code.decode_geometry`, so the `hG` existential of `hdata` is free too.
* `areaRate_pos` — the area exit rate `π(v)/a(v)` is positive at every cell:
  `π(v) > 0` by connectivity (`pi_pos_of_connected`) and `a(v) > 0` because the cell
  is compact with nonempty interior (`StatementIngredients.cellArea_pos`).
* `energyMinimizer` — the `EnergyMinimizer` existential of `EnvironmentWalkData`
  is discharged from Proposition 1.3 (`ConductanceGraph.energyMin` and its three
  characterising lemmas) at the connectivity witness above.
* the **admissible fast clock** conjunct of `EnvironmentWalkData`, i.e.
  `IsReflectedWalk G (D.rateFunction hG) hmin (Existence.processFamily D hG
  (D.rateFunction hG))`, is `Forms.canonical_isReflectedWalk_of_rate_le` at
  `w = D.rateFunction hG`, where the domination hypothesis is `le_refl`.

## The one residual input

The **area clock** conjunct of `EnvironmentWalkData` is the only part that is not
discharged.  Through `ReflectedWalk.Existence.isReflectedWalk` and the
unconditional `ReflectedWalk.Existence.markovProperty` it needs exactly the
manuscript's (3.16) for `w = areaRate`, and through
`IndexSet.holdingTimesSummable_of` together with the unconditional level-`0`
divergence `Exhaustion.jointLaw_ae_tsum_holding_addr_zero_eq_top` (which holds for
*every* positive rate) it needs exactly the finiteness half of (3.16):

`AreaClockReachesLevelZeroIndices` — for every starting cell, almost surely every
level-`0` index `[(0,K)]` is reached in **finite area time**.

This is the manuscript's local finiteness of the area clock, and it is *not* a
restatement of any conclusion of the main theorem: it is the pathwise statement
that the area clock does not blow up before a fixed index of the coupled chain.
Lemma 3.5 (`Exhaustion.rateFunction_ae_holdingTimesSummable`) is unavailable for it,
because that lemma needs `areaRate ≥ D.rateFunction hG` off a finite set, which no
environment hypothesis supplies; the honest route is the occupation-integral
identity with `Process.AreaClockLocalFiniteness.areaClock_finite_on_compact_times`,
which is *not* performed here.

Every theorem below that depends on the residual carries it as an explicit
hypothesis, so nothing here asserts `hdata`.
