# Quenched formulation of the reflected spatial conclusions

Manuscript label `r:cor:quenched`: *conditional on almost every environment, the
reflected walk from each starting cell satisfies `r:eq:localbounded` and never
hits an end at spatial infinity*.

The manuscript proof is the countability passage: the deterministic theorem is
applied on the probability-one set where its assumptions hold, and "there are
only countably many possible starting cells in each environment".  This file
performs exactly that passage over the existing
`ReflectedGMS.InvarianceMainStatement` vocabulary.  The starting cells of a coded
environment `e` are `Code.Vertex e.val = {n : ℕ // (e.val.1 n).isSome}`, a
subtype of `ℕ`, so the per-start almost-sure statements are indexed by the fixed
countable type `ℕ` and `MeasureTheory.ae_all_iff` applies uniformly in `e`.  No
measurability of the conclusion event is needed: the `ae` filter has the
countable intersection property because a countable union of null sets is null,
and null sets are defined by the outer measure, not by measurability.

## What is proved

`ae_forall_start_quenchedWalkConclusion` is manuscript `r:cor:quenched` itself, over the
canonical constructed exponential-area-clock reflected walk.  Its conclusion clauses are
exactly the two named in the corollary: `r:eq:localbounded`, i.e.
`sup {|z_{X_t}| : 0 ≤ t ≤ T, X_t ∈ 𝓗} < ∞` simultaneously for all finite `T`, and the
existence of a unique end-labelled lift of the path which never takes an end at spatial
infinity.  Its hypotheses are exactly the corollary's own: the hypotheses of Theorem
`r:thm:main` hold almost surely with environment-dependent `C` and `R_*` (the predicate
`hcut`, whose shape is literally the conclusion of the checked producer
`Spatial/AlmostSureCutoffBounds.ae_exists_logCutoff_hypotheses`), a measurable labelling of
the cells by representatives, and conditional reflected-walk laws given the environment for
an admissible clock (`EnvironmentWalkData`).  No open conclusion predicate occurs in the
statement or in the proof.  `ae_quenchedWalkConclusion_of_massTransport`
then discharges `hcut` from mass transport, the manuscript's finite (FE) moment and the
almost-sure ball bound on the rooted (FE) density.

## What is *not* proved

The predicate `QuenchedSpatialConclusion` below is a strictly stronger *packaging* form: it
additionally demands a càdlàg pathwise spatial extension `Z` of the end-labelled path, with
`Z` continuous at every end-valued time.  That extra clause is not part of manuscript
`r:cor:quenched` — `r:eq:localbounded` constrains `|z_{X_t}|` at vertex times only — and the
construction of such an extension is an open obligation elsewhere in the project (see
`Forms/SpatialInfinityAvoidance.lean`).  The theorems below that produce
`QuenchedSpatialConclusion` are therefore still genuine implications from the open predicate
`FixedStartConclusions`, and are labelled as such in their docstrings; they supply the
quenched packaging only.

/-- The start-free part of `InvarianceMainStatement.EnvironmentProcessConclusions`:
the actual reflected-walk properties of the canonical construction for one
environment, one exhaustion and one connectivity witness.  These clauses are
copied verbatim from `EnvironmentProcessConclusions`; separating them is what
allows the exhaustion to be chosen once per environment and then used for every
starting cell. -/

/-- The countability passage of the manuscript proof, in the exact dependent
form needed here: the starting cells of a coded environment form a subtype of
`ℕ`, so an almost-sure statement for each label index gives one almost-sure
event on which the statement holds simultaneously at every actual vertex.
The exceptional set is a countable union of null sets; no measurability of the
individual events is required. -/

/-- **The deterministic theorem applied inside one environment, at one starting cell.**
For the canonical constructed reflected walk with any admissible rate `w`, the logarithmic
cutoff hypothesis tuple `hr₀, hC, ho, hD, hW` of manuscript Proposition `r:prop:log` gives
both conclusions of Theorem `r:thm:main` almost surely.

This is exactly the pair of checked theorems
`LogCutoffSpatialBoundedness.reflected_ae_forall_bddAbove_norm_on_boundedTime` and
`LogCutoffSpatialBoundedness.reflected_ae_existsUnique_endLabelLift_avoidsSpatialInfinity_of_logCutoff`,
specialized to `F = decode e`, the representative rule `z.at e`, and the canonical process
family `Existence.processFamily D hG w`; nothing else is used. -/

/-- **Conditional quenched wrapper.**  From the environment-level walk data holding almost
surely, together with the fixed-start conclusions holding almost surely for each
individual starting label, one gets a single probability-one set of environments
on which the conclusions hold simultaneously for *every* starting cell.

The exhaustion, the connectivity witness and the walk data are quantified inside
the per-label hypothesis, so the start-free data selected on the left is the same
data used at every start; this is what makes the interchange of `∀ start` and
`∀ᵐ e` legitimate. -/
