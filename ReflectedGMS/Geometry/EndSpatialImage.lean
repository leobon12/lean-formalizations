# Spatial images of graph ends

This file proves **Proposition 2.3** ("Spatial images of ends") of the singular-set manuscript
("An invariance principle for reflected random walks with spatial singularities").

For a face configuration `F` with a singular set (`GeometrySingular`, Definition 1.1) and a graph
end `e` of the cell adjacency graph, the manuscript forms, for each finite vertex set `K`, the
*spherical closure* of the union of the cells indexed by the component of `G \ K` that `e`
selects, and proves that the intersection of these closures over all `K` is a single point of
`Ssing ∪ {∞}`.

Everything happens in the one-point compactification `OnePoint Plane`, which is the manuscript's
Riemann sphere; only its topology is used.

## Deviations from the manuscript's proof, and why

* **The index is the full directed family of finite vertex sets, not a chosen exhaustion.**  The
  manuscript fixes `Kₙ ↑ H` and then argues separately that the resulting point is independent of
  the exhaustion, by cofinality.  Here `K` ranges over all of `Finset V`, directed by `⊆`, and every
  exhaustion is cofinal in that family, so independence of the exhaustion is not a separate
  statement: no exhaustion occurs in `endImage`.  Likewise `endImage` mentions neither the
  geometric witnesses nor any choice of cell representatives, so independence of those is visible
  from the definition rather than proved.
* **The singleton step avoids the chordal metric.**  The manuscript concludes by saying that
  `Ssing ∪ {∞}` is `H¹`-null for the chordal metric of the sphere, while a connected set containing
  two points at distance `r` has `H¹ ≥ r`.  Pinned mathlib puts no metric on `OnePoint X`
  (`Mathlib/Topology/Compactification/OnePoint/Sphere.lean` supplies only homeomorphisms, with no
  measure transfer), so building the chordal metric would be a separate development.  Instead the
  same separation argument is run *in the plane*: if the intersection contained two distinct points
  then, for every `t` in an interval of positive lengths, the open sets `ball z t` and the
  complement of `closedBall z t` (the latter open in `OnePoint Plane` because the closed ball is
  compact) would disconnect each `endCellClosure F e K`, so each of them meets the sphere of radius
  `t`, and hence so does the intersection, by compactness.  The `1`-Lipschitz map `x ↦ dist x z`
  then sends the intersection onto a set containing an interval, forcing `μH[1] > 0` where the
  manuscript's hypothesis `μH[1] Ssing = 0` forces `0`.  This handles the point `∞` uniformly with
  finite points, because `∞` lies outside every `(↑) '' closedBall z t`.
* **Continuity of `e ↦ endImage F e` is stated without an end topology.**  Pinned mathlib defines
  `SimpleGraph.end` (as `Functor.sections`) but puts **no** `TopologicalSpace` instance on it, and
  `Mathlib/Combinatorics/` contains no `TopologicalSpace` instance at all.  Rather than invent one,
  `exists_finset_forall_endImage_mem` states exactly the content the manuscript's continuity proof
  uses: for every neighbourhood `U` of `endImage F e` there is a finite `K` such that *every* end
  agreeing with `e` at `K` has its image in `U`.  In the usual end topology the sets
  `{e' | e'.val (op K) = e.val (op K)}` are a neighbourhood basis at `e`, so this statement is
  continuity for that topology.

## Main results

* `isConnected_biUnion_cell` — a connected graph of connected sets whose members intersect at
  adjacent vertices has connected union.
* `exists_unique_endImage` — Proposition 2.3, equation (2.1).
* `endImage`, `endImageSet_eq_singleton`, `endImage_mem_sing`.
* `exists_forall_endCellClosure_subset` — the uniform localization of (2.1).
* `endImage_eq_infty_iff` — the image is `∞` exactly for the spatial-infinity ends of
  `ReflectedGMS.SpatialEnds.AtSpatialInfinity`.
* `exists_finset_forall_endImage_mem` — continuity, in the topology-free form described above.

## Minimal hypotheses

The argument uses, about the cells, only that every cell is connected and that adjacent cells
intersect (`ConnectedAdjacentCells`), and about the singular set `S` only that `μH[1] S = 0` and
that every point off `S` has a neighbourhood meeting finitely many cells (`LocallyFiniteOff`).
Closedness of `S`, the covering clause, the face rule, the exceptional set `V*`, graph
connectedness and graph local finiteness are never used (the last two only for the anti-vacuity
statement `nonempty_graphEnd_of_infinite`).  The core results are therefore stated under exactly
these hypotheses, with the suffix `_of_cells` (and `endImageSet_subset_of_locallyFiniteOff`,
`endImage_mem_of_locallyFiniteOff`, which need only the local finiteness); the statements from
`GeometrySingular` and `SingularWitness` are recovered from them as thin corollaries under their
original names.  This is what lets the general-cell manuscript's Proposition 2.6, whose witness
has no face rule and no `V*`, reuse the proof verbatim
(`ReflectedGMS/Geometry/EndSpatialImageGeneral.lean`).

while its image contains an interval, whose `H¹` is its length because `μH[1] = volume` on `ℝ`.

### A consistency check on (2.1)

The conclusion of `exists_unique_endImage` is not a formality: it pins the point down.  When the
cells cover the whole plane, i.e. the singular set is empty, it forces the spatial image of *every*
end to be `∞`, which is the expected specialisation (local finiteness everywhere makes a component
that stayed in a bounded region finite).
-/

/-- **Anti-vacuity.**  A configuration with a singular set whose vertex set is infinite has at
least one end, so `exists_unique_endImage` is not a statement about an empty index: the cell
adjacency graph is connected and locally finite by `GeometrySingular`, and mathlib's
`SimpleGraph.nonempty_ends_of_infinite` then applies.  (The type variable is at `Type` because that
is the universe of the mathlib lemma.) -/
