# A measurable, similarity-invariant reachability weight on code slots

The re-rooting statement behind `hnbr` transports the specific-energy density from a whole
graph ball back to the root cell.  The transport kernel therefore has to carry the
combinatorial indicator `1_{d_G(u,v) ≤ k}`, and a `MassTransportKernel` needs that indicator

* **measurable** as a function of the environment, and
* **invariant** under the relabelling induced by a physical similarity.

`SimpleGraph.edist` on the subtype `Code.Vertex e.val` is neither of those things directly:
it is defined through an existential over walks in a graph whose *vertex type itself* depends
on `e`.  This module replaces it by a slot-level recursion on the raw conductance matrix
`e.val.2 : ℕ → ℕ → ℝ`, which has a fixed index type and is manifestly measurable.

* `reach c k n n'` — one step of neighbour saturation, `k` times: it is `1` when `n'` can be
  reached from `n` along at most `k` edges of positive conductance, `0` otherwise
  (`reach_le_one`, `one_le_reach_self`).
* `one_le_reach_of_mem_ball` — the only comparison the transport needs: every vertex of the
  graph ball `B(r, k+1)` is reached, so `reach` dominates the indicator of the ball.
* `reach_eq_zero_of_absent_source` — absent slots carry no conductance
  (`Code.AdmissibleConductance.absent`) and therefore reach nothing but themselves.  This is
  what lets a slot-indexed transport sum be rewritten as a sum over actual vertices.
* `reach_relabel` — invariance under `EnvironmentLaws.IsSimilarityRelabel`: conductances are
  similarity invariant, so reachability is a physical, not a labelling, notion.
* `measurable_reach` — measurability in the environment, by induction on the number of steps.

Nothing here is probabilistic and nothing here mentions cells, areas or densities.

/-! ### The slot-level reachability weight -/

/-- `reach c k n n'` is `1` when the slot `n'` is reachable from the slot `n` along at most
`k` edges of positive conductance, and `0` otherwise.  The recursion is the usual neighbour
saturation: either `n'` is already reachable in `k` steps, or one first moves across an edge
out of `n`. -/
