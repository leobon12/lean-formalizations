# The input `hdens` of the harmonic-coordinate assembly, discharged

`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.MarkedDensityMeasurability ν ms` is the named open input that
bundles the four measurability statements the approximation clause (7) of
`HarmonicMainStatement.IsHarmonicCoordinate` needs:

1. the graph-neighbourhood errors `markedGraphNeighborhoodError ms radius m`;
2. the rooted specific energy of every stage `φ_m`;
3. the rooted specific energy of the gradient errors `φ_m − Φ`
   (`markedSpecificGradientError`);
4. the rooted specific energy of the marked limit `Φ` itself.

The assembly records that the project had **no producer** for any of them — the same gap that
`hΓmeas` used to carry in `InvarianceAssembly`.  This module discharges the whole input from
the manuscript's own hypotheses, the measurability input `hmeas` of the assembly, and nothing
else: `markedDensityMeasurability_of_massTransport`.

## Clauses 2–4: the rooted specific energy

These are instances of `MarkedRootedSpecificEnergyMeasurability.measurable_rootedSpecificEnergyDensity`,
which is unconditional.  Mass transport and the (FE) moment enter only through
`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.ae_mem_sublinearEvent`, which identifies the gated interpolant
`gatedApproximant m` — the field `hmeas` asserts to be measurable — with the concrete `phi` at
the active labels of almost every marked environment.  Clause 4 needs neither: the marked
limit already *is* a measurable label field.

## Clause 1: the graph-neighbourhood error

This is the genuinely new ingredient.  The supremum runs over the ball of the **graph
metric** of the decoded environment, around a root selected by a geometric test, in a vertex
type that varies with the environment; none of that is a composition of measurable coordinate
maps.

The route replaces the graph ball by a label-level predicate.  `LazyReach e r k n` says that
the label `n` is joined to `r` by a chain of at most `k` positive conductance entries of the
code `e`, allowing repetitions.  It is defined by recursion on `k`, so each of its level sets
is a countable union of measurable conditions (`measurableSet_lazyReach`).  Two walk lemmas
identify it with the graph ball:

* `lazyReach_of_walk` — every walk of the decoded simple graph yields a chain of its own
  length, by induction on the walk;
* `edist_le_of_lazyReach` — every chain of length `k` bounds the graph `edist` by `k`, by the
  triangle inequality and `SimpleGraph.edist_eq_one_iff_adj`; the intermediate labels are
  automatically active because an absent label carries no positive conductance
  (`Code.AdmissibleConductance.absent`).

Together they give `mem_ball_iff_lazyReach`, and the supremum over the ball becomes a
supremum over **all** labels of a clipped term that vanishes off the ball
(`labelNeighborhoodError_eq`).  Clipping at `1` makes every term lie in `[0, 1]`, so the
conditional suprema are bounded without any finiteness of the ball.  The root is then handled
by the slot-sum technique of `Spatial/RootedFiniteEnergyDensityMeasurable`: at most one label
has the origin in its cell interior, and on the boundary mask the observable is zero by
convention.

## Scope

Nothing here proves that the neighbourhood errors converge (that is the separate input
`hnbr`), that the specific energies are finite (that is `hspec`), or that the concrete
interpolants are measurable (that is `hmeas`, which enters only as a hypothesis).  This file
proves no main theorem: `harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_named_inputs_of_nine` is the
assembly's reduction with one of its ten inputs removed, and its nine remaining hypotheses
are open.

/-- **Bounded lazy reachability of code labels.**  `LazyReach e r k n` holds when the label
`n` is joined to `r` by a chain of at most `k` positive conductance entries of `e`;
repetitions are allowed, so the predicate is monotone in `k` by construction.  Intermediate
