# The centroid field is measurable, and the block-interpolant selection splits in two

`Corrector/GatedApproximantMeasurability.lean` reduces the input `hmeas` of the harmonic
coordinate assembly to `IsBlockInterpolantSelection m Θ`: a field `Θ`, measurable in the
marked environment, which on `SublinearEvent` **is** a block interpolant whenever one
exists and **is the centroid field** whenever none exists.  The second clause is forced by
the default branch of the `Classical.choose` in `DyadicApproximation.phi`.

This module supplies two things that every producer of that selection needs.

## (1) The centroid field is measurable — unconditionally

`StatementIngredients.cellCentroid F v = (cellArea F v)⁻¹ • ∫ z in F.cell v, z` is a
*vector* integral over a compact cell, and nothing in the project made it a measurable
function of the environment: `Spatial.NullBoundaryRoots` proves measurability of the cell
*volume* (`measurable_cellVolume`), of cell membership (`measurableSet_cellMem`) and of
interior and frontier membership, but the barycentre `∫ z in K, z` never appears there, nor
anywhere else in the three trees.

`measurable_cellIntegral` fills that hole with exactly the `NullBoundaryRoots` template, for
the Bochner integral instead of the lower integral: the jointly measurable membership
indicator of `measurableSet_cellMem`, valued in `Plane` instead of `ℝ≥0∞`, fed to
`MeasureTheory.StronglyMeasurable.integral_prod_right'`.  `measurable_slotCentroid` then
reads the centroid at a *code slot*, so that absent slots carry a canonical value and no
vertex subtype occurs, and `slotCentroid_eq_cellCentroid` identifies it with `cellCentroid`
at every active label.  `centroidField` is the marked form.

## (2) The selection splits into a candidate and one measurable event

`isBlockInterpolantSelection_gate` is the factorisation.  Given

* a measurable candidate field `Ψ`,
* the **conditional correctness** `hex`: on the good event, *if* a block interpolant exists
  then `Ψ` is one,
* and measurability of the single event `{ω | Ψ ω is a block interpolant at stage m}`,

the field `gateSelection m Ψ`, which is `Ψ` on that event and the centroid field off it,
is a `IsBlockInterpolantSelection m`.  The centroid clause is then **free**: off the gate
event `Ψ` is not a block interpolant, so in particular no block interpolant equal to `Ψ`
exists, and the fallback is exactly the centroid field demanded by the default branch of
`phi`.  `measurable_gatedApproximant_of_gates` composes this with
`GatedApproximantMeasurability.measurable_gatedApproximant_of_selection`, producing `hmeas`
in the exact shape taken by `HarmonicCoordinateSevenInputs`.

`gateEvent_inter_sublinearEvent` records why this is the right split: under `hex` the gate
event and the *existence* event `{ω | ∃ f, IsBlockInterpolation … f}` agree on the good
event, so the residual measurability is not an artefact of the fallback — it is the
measurability of block-interpolant existence itself, expressed at a single measurable field
rather than under an existential quantifier.

## (3) Stage `0` is discharged outright

`isBlockInterpolantSelection_zero` proves `IsBlockInterpolantSelection 0 centroidField` with
no hypotheses: `IsBlockInterpolation F D 0 f` *is* `f = cellCentroid F`.  This is also the
satisfiability witness for the structure and for the hypotheses of the gate theorem
(`gate_hypotheses_satisfiable_zero`), which is recorded explicitly because a selection
statement that no field can satisfy, or that holds only on a null event, would be vacuous.

**This file proves no main theorem and does not certify `hmeas`.**  For a stage `m ≥ 1` both
the candidate `Ψ` and the measurability of the gate event remain open; the file removes the
centroid branch, the measurability of the boundary data, and the stage `0` case from that
problem.
