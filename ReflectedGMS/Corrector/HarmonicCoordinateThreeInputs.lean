# The harmonic-coordinate reduction at **three** named inputs

`Corrector/HarmonicCoordinateFiveInputs.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_five_inputs` reduces the
harmonic-coordinate theorem to the five named inputs `hmeas, hproj, hmax, hcopies, hsub`.  Three
of those five have since been produced, in modules that had **no importers**, so no checked
statement carried the resulting count.  This file composes them.

## What is composed (all by application; no binder is restated)

| five-input binder | producer | residue |
|---|---|---|
| `hmax` — `StageDifferenceWeakMaximal.MarkedStageDifferenceWeakMaximal ν` | `Spatial/AuxiliaryGridMarkedSpaceProjection.markedStageDifferenceWeakMaximal_auxTwoGrid` | `hmeas` |
| `hsub` — `MarkedCentroidSublinearity ν ms` | `Spatial/AuxiliaryGridMarkedSpaceProjection.markedResidualWeakMaximal_auxTwoGrid` fed to `Corrector/HarmonicCoordinateResidualOnly.markedCentroidSublinearity_of_residualMaximal` | `hmeas` (+ `hharm`, `hspec`, both *produced inside* the assembly) |
| `hcopies` — `DifferenceFieldGridIndependent ν ms` | `Spatial/CopyDifferenceThreeGridProjection.differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_originEnergy_threeGrid` | `hmeas` and `hzero` |

## DISCHARGED vs REDUCED — stated exactly

* **DISCHARGED** (no residue at all beyond the manuscript's own `hν`, `hFE` and the assembly's
  `hmeas`): the entire marked-space producer for all three binders — `hchain`, `hdata`, `henv`,
  `hprojA`, `hmap`, `hshift`, `hdilate`, and for the copy lane also `hcov`, `hinv`.  Also
  discharged outright: `MarkedGeometricMassQuadratic` (inside
  `markedCentroidSublinearity_of_residualMaximal`), and `hgeom`, `hconv`, `hpatch`, `hharm`,
  `hspec`, which are produced from `hproj`, `hmax` and `hmeas` inside the five-input route.
* **REDUCED, not discharged**: `hmax` and the maximal input of `hsub` are reduced to `hmeas`;
  `hcopies` is reduced to `hmeas` together with `hzero`.

## `hsub` costs exactly one input, and it is `hmeas` — traced

`hsub = MarkedCentroidSublinearity ν ms` is produced by
`HarmonicCoordinateResidualOnly.markedCentroidSublinearity_of_residualMaximal` from
`hharm : MarkedHarmonicity ν ms`, `MarkedResidualWeakMaximal ν ms` and
`hspec : MarkedSpecificEnergyConvergence ν ms` (the `MarkedGeometricMassQuadratic` half of
`SmallBlockResidualProducer.markedCentroidSublinearity_of_weakMaximal` is discharged there from
`hν`/`hFE`).  Of those three, `markedResidualWeakMaximal_auxTwoGrid` supplies the second from
`hmeas`; the other two are **not** extra inputs here, because the five-input route already
manufactures them along its own subsequence: `hharm` from `hpatch` by
`MarkedRectangleOrthogonalityProducer.markedHarmonicity_of_patchConvergence`, and `hspec` from
`hproj`, `hmeas` and `hconv` by
`SpecificEnergyConvergence.markedSpecificEnergyConvergence_of_nestedProjection`.  That is why the
composition has to reproduce the five-input route's *body* rather than apply its statement: the
statement asks for `hsub` uniformly in `ms`, and `hharm`/`hspec` are available only at the
subsequence `hproj` produces.  Everything below is still application-style; no binder is inlined.

## Honest count: **three** named open inputs

`hmeas`, `hproj`, `hzero`.  (`hν : MassTransport ν` and `hFE : FiniteEnergyMoment ν` are the
manuscript's own environment hypotheses, `s:eq:MTP` and (FE), not open obligations.)

* `hmeas` — measurability of the gated approximants, the assembly's own input.
* `hproj` — `SpecificEnergyConvergence.MarkedNestedProjectionBound ν`.  Deliberately taken as a
  binder: a separate lane owns its reduction and is editing there, so nothing here depends on it.
* `hzero` — the manuscript's cross orthogonality in its integrability-free `ℝ≥0∞` form, the
  vanishing of the expected rooted specific-energy density at the origin of the difference of the
  two grid-copy potentials.  By
  `Corrector/CopyDifferenceInputReduction.integral_rootedPairing_diff_self_eq` this is the
  irreducible content of `hcopies`.

`hzero` is asked uniformly in the subsequence, exactly as the five-input theorem asks `hcopies`
and `hsub`; this is **no strengthening** relative to that head (indeed it is asked only for
strictly monotone `ms`).  `harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_rate_and_originEnergy` below is the
fixed-`ms` variant that quantifies over nothing, at the price of carrying `hgeom` and `hspec` as
binders.

**This file proves no main theorem.**  Every statement here is an implication, and it certifies
none of its inputs: `hmeas`, `hproj` and `hzero` are open.

# `hsub` removed from the harmonic-coordinate reduction

`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_named_inputs` carries ten open
inputs, of which `hsub` (`MarkedCentroidSublinearity`) is the **only** carrier of
non-degeneracy: the adversarial statement audit checked that the zero field satisfies
`GradientCovariant`, `NormalizedCovariant`, `RootNormalized`, `DiscreteHarmonicity` and
`FullRectangleOrthogonality`, and the representative-independent clause of
`SublinearCorrector` (`Environment/Potentials.lean:50-51`) is derived from `hsub`.

This module states the reduction with `hsub` gone.  It composes

* `Corrector/CentroidSublinearityFromResidual` and
  `Corrector/MarkedCentroidSublinearityProducer` — `hsub` from `s:eq:smallresidual`
  (`MarkedSmallBlockResidual`) and `s:eq:Wbound` in quadratic form
  (`MarkedGeometricMassQuadratic`);
* `Corrector/GeometricMassQuadraticProducer` — `MarkedGeometricMassQuadratic` **discharged**
  from `s:eq:MTP` and the finite (FE) moment alone;
* `Corrector/SmallBlockResidualProducer` — `MarkedSmallBlockResidual` from the manuscript's
  weak-`L¹` maximal inequality `s:eq:maximal` applied to the residual density
  (`MarkedResidualWeakMaximal`), together with `hspec`, an input the assembly already takes.

So `hsub` is replaced by exactly **one** new hypothesis, `MarkedResidualWeakMaximal`, and no
other input of the assembly changes.  That hypothesis is the project's own
`Spatial/SimilarityBlockAveraging.measure_ballMaximal_gt_le_similarity` read at the residual
density instead of the rooted (FE) density; what is missing to instantiate it is recorded in
the docstring of `Corrector/SmallBlockResidualProducer`.

**This file proves no main theorem.**  Its statements are implications with open hypotheses;
a conditional reduction certifies neither its inputs nor `HarmonicCoordinateMainTheorem`.

/-- **`hmax`, the maximal half of `hsub`, and the maximal half of `hcopies` discharged, at a
subsequence fixed in advance.**

Compared with
`Corrector/HarmonicCoordinateFiveInputs.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_rate_and_weakMaximal`,
whose six binders are `hgeom, hmax, hmeas, hcopies, hsub, hspec`, three are gone: `hmax` and
`hsub` entirely, and `hcopies` down to `hzero`.  The remaining named inputs are

`hgeom, hmeas, hspec, hzero`,

and `hgeom`/`hspec` are precisely what `hproj` produces in the quantified form below.  Nothing is
strengthened: every binder is asked at the one `ms` supplied. -/
