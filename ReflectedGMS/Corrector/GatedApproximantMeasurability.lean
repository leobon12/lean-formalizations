# Measurability of the gated block interpolants

This module attacks the input `hmeas` of
`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_named_inputs`,

`∀ m n : ℕ, Measurable fun ω : MarkedEnvironment => gatedApproximant m ω n`,

which the assembly names as having two halves: measurability of the good event
`SublinearEvent`, and a measurable selection of block minimizers agreeing with the concrete
`DyadicApproximation.phi` on that event.

* **The first half is discharged outright.**  `measurableSet_sublinearEvent` proves
  `MeasurableSet SublinearEvent` from the checked reduction of sublinear diameter decay to
  rational slopes, natural thresholds and rational radii
  (`GoodEnvironmentSet.sublinearDiameterDecay_iff_rat`) together with measurability of the
  large-cell diameter `D_R` as a countable slot supremum
  (`GoodEnvironmentSet.measurable_maxDiamHittingBall`).  This is unconditional.

* **The second half is isolated as one named, specification-shaped hypothesis.**
  `IsBlockInterpolantSelection m Θ` asks for a label-indexed field `Θ`, measurable in the
  marked environment, which on the good event **is** a block interpolant whenever one exists
  and is the centroid field whenever none exists.  No reference to `phi`, to
  `Classical.choose` or to any measurability beyond `Measurable fun ω => Θ ω n` occurs in it,
  and nothing at all is required off the good event or at inactive labels.

`eq_phi_of_isBlockInterpolantSelection` then identifies such a `Θ` with `phi` on the good
event — through uniqueness of block interpolants under sublinear diameter decay,
`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.isBlockInterpolation_unique`, in the existence branch, and
through the default clause of `phi` in the non-existence branch, which is exactly why the
selection must also prescribe the centroid field there.  Measurability of `hmeas` follows in
`measurable_gatedApproximant_of_eq_phi` — whose hypothesis is only that some measurably
varying field agrees with `phi` at the active labels of the good event, so a producer working
directly with `phi` can enter there — and in its corollary
`measurable_gatedApproximant_of_selection`, and
`harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_blockInterpolantSelection` restates the assembly's
reduction with `hmeas` replaced by the selection.

**This file proves no main theorem and does not certify `hmeas`.**  It removes the good-event
half of that input and reduces the rest to a pointwise selection property; a conditional
reduction certifies neither its input nor `HarmonicCoordinateMainTheorem`.

## Why the remaining half is not a small addendum

The concrete `phi F D m` is a `Classical.choose` over `∃ f, IsBlockInterpolation F D m f`,
defaulting to `cellCentroid F`, and existence of a block interpolant is **not** implied by
the gate: `PatchCentroidTraceFiniteEnergy.exists_isBlockInterpolation_of_spatialCellBounds`
derives it from the manuscript `W`-bound `SpatialDiameterCellBounds`, strictly stronger than
`SublinearDiameterDecay`.  So the selection has to be built, not chosen: the pinned mathlib
carries no measurable-selection theorem at all, and the project's own measurable minimizers
(`Corrector/MeasurableBlockMinimizer`, `Corrector/MeasurableInfinitePatchMinimizer`) are
scalar, are stated for one fixed countable vertex type, and assume boundary anchoring and
finite reference energy at *every* parameter value — all three of which the block problem
violates as stated (its vertex type `Vertex ω.1.val` varies with the environment, its data
are `Plane`-valued, and the centroid trace has finite patch energy only under the `W`-bound).

/-! ### Measurable selections of block interpolants -/

/-- **A measurable selection of block interpolants at stage `m`.**

`Θ` is a label-indexed field, measurable in the marked environment, which at every marked
environment of the good event is a block interpolant whenever one exists, and is the centroid
field whenever none exists.  The second clause is not cosmetic: the concrete `phi` is a
`Classical.choose` which defaults to the centroid field exactly when no block interpolant
exists, so a selection that says nothing there cannot identify it.

Nothing is required off the good event, and nothing is required at inactive labels. -/
