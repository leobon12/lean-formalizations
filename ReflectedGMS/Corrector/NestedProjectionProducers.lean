# Producers for the nested energy projection `s:eq:pythmn`

`Corrector/NestedEnergyProjections.blockPythagoras_nested` proves the manuscript identity
`ℰ_{G_S}(φ_m) = ℰ_{G_S}(φ_n) + ℰ_{G_S}(φ_m - φ_n)` on a block `S ∈ 𝒮_n` of the `n`-partition
from two *explicit structural* hypotheses:

* `hmtr` — the **geometric pinning** `s:eq:pinnested`: `φ_m = b` on the spatial boundary of
  every `n`-block, which rests on `skel_n ⊆ skel_m` for `n ≥ m`; and
* `hmE` — finiteness of the energy of `φ_m` **on that single block**.

This module discharges the first of these from the actual dyadic geometry, and supplies the
signed edge-sum identity needed to feed the blockwise orthogonality into the mass-transport
redistribution.  The block-local energy finiteness `hmE` is *not* discharged here and stays
visible in every statement below; no finite energy of the whole infinite network is used or
assumed anywhere.

## The geometric half — `s:eq:pinnested`

* `mem_frontier_square_of_selected_of_le` — the exact coarsening statement at the level of a
  single point: if `S` is selected at parameter `m`, `T` is selected at parameter `n ≥ m`,
  and a point `z` of `∂T` lies in `S`, then `z ∈ ∂S`.  The proof is a level comparison along
  the ancestor chain, using only the checked `ActiveBlockEdges` geometry
  (`square_subset_ancestor`, `notMem_square_of_mem_interior_of_same_level`,
  `blockIndex_ancestor_monotone`): if `T` is strictly below `S` in level, the ancestor of `T`
  at `S`'s level has `κ` above `n ≥ m ≥ κ(S)`, so it is a *different* square of the same
  level and the lattice separates it from the interior of `S`; otherwise the ancestor of `S`
  at `T`'s level either differs from `T`, which the lattice again excludes, or equals `T`, in
  which case `S ⊆ T` and a point of `∂T` cannot be interior to `S`.
* `SelectionCoversOn` — the manuscript's §3.1 covering statement, *"the closures of the blocks
  cover every point belonging to a cell"*, the one structural input of the coarsening that is
  genuinely about the existence of the `κ`-stopping line and is not proved here.  The
  every-point form `SelectionCovers` is no longer available under the covering clause of
  `Geometry` and is kept only as the sharper hypothesis and for the no-regression bridges
  `SelectionCovers.on` and `SelectionCoversOn.toSelectionCovers`.
* `skeleton_subset_skeleton_of_le` — **`skel_n ⊆ skel_m` for `n ≥ m`**.
* `pinned_on_boundary_of_isBlockInterpolation` — the consumer form: `φ_m = b` on the spatial
  boundary of every `n`-selected square, for any `φ_m` satisfying the project's actual
  `DyadicApproximation.IsBlockInterpolation` (both the `m = 0` and the `m ≠ 0` clause).
* `blockPythagoras_nested_of_isBlockInterpolation` — `s:eq:pythmn` on an `n`-block with
  `hmtr` *removed*, stated directly for the actual nested block maps
  `IsBlockInterpolation F D m fm`, `IsBlockInterpolation F D n fn`.

## The signed-pairing half

`ActiveBlockEdges.vectorEnergy_eq_tsum_vectorGradSq` identifies the vector energy with half an
edge sum of the *nonnegative* coefficients `vectorGradSq`.  The redistribution of the
manuscript's *signed* coefficient `c(e) g(e)·g'(e)` needs the same identification for the
polarized coefficient:

* `vectorGradProd` — the plane-valued polarization of `vectorGradSq`, built from the existing
  `ReflectedWalk.ConductanceGraph.gradProd`;
* `ofReal_vectorGradProd_self` — `vectorGradProd G f f = vectorGradSq G f`, so the signed
  coefficient really polarizes the checked nonnegative one;
* `summable_vectorGradProd` — absolute summability from the two **block-local** energies,
  through the existing `ConductanceGraph.summable_gradProd` (pointwise Cauchy–Schwarz);
* `tsum_vectorGradProd_eq_two_mul_vectorPairing` — **`∑_e c(e) g(e)·g'(e) = 2 ⟪f, f'⟫_G`**;
* `tsum_vectorGradProd_sub_eq_zero_of_centroidTraceMinimizer` and
  `tsum_vectorGradProd_nested_eq_zero` — *"their sum on every block is zero by
  orthogonality"*, for the base competitor and for the actual nested pair `(φ_n, φ_m - φ_n)`.

What is still missing for the expected root densities is the packaging of the positive and
negative parts of that block sum as an `OwnedEdgeField` with measurable owner labels, and the
polarization of the expected root density itself; both are separately staffed.

/-- The *every point* form of the covering statement: every point of the plane lies in some
square selected at parameter `m`.  This is a statement about the existence of the
`κ`-stopping line — the same input as the hypotheses of
`DiameterBlockIndex.exists_selected_ancestor` — and is **not** proved here; it is strictly
weaker than, and says nothing about, the pinning conclusion below.

**It is no longer available under the covering clause of `Geometry`**, which only asks
`μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0`.  The producers of the covering statement all go through a cell
containing the prescribed point — that is what bounds the block index of the squares around it
and forces one of them to be selected — and an uncovered point supplies no such cell; see
`Spatial/NonmacroscopicSelectedBlocks.exists_selected_mem`, whose covering side condition is
not removable.  `SelectionCoversOn` below is the manuscript's own statement and is what every
consumer actually uses; this definition is kept because at an environment with
`uncoveredSet F = ∅` the two agree (`SelectionCoversOn.toSelectionCovers`) and the old form
remains the sharper hypothesis to supply whenever it is available (`SelectionCovers.on`). -/

This is `SelectionCovers` with the conclusion asked only at the covered points.  It is not a
weakening in any place it is used: both consumers in the tree —
`skeleton_subset_skeleton_of_le` here and
`PairingOwnershipInstance.exists_selected_patch_of_adj` — apply it at a point that has just
been produced *inside a cell*, so the hypothesis `z ∉ uncoveredSet F` is discharged on the spot
by `notMem_uncoveredSet_of_mem_cell`.  Its domain is not empty either: the covered points are
