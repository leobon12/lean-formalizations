# The selection event of an *arbitrary* dyadic square is measurable

`Spatial/MeasurableSelectedBlocks.lean` proves that the block index `κ` and every selection
event are jointly measurable in the environment and the grid **along the origin chain**
(`measurableSet_originSelected`).  The restriction is not incidental: the ancestor indices of
the origin chain are the explicit levels `originIndex (k + j)`
(`MarkedBlockAveraging.ancestor_originIndex`), a formula free of the grid, whereas for a
general square index `s` the ancestor `ancestor D s j` depends on the grid through its parent
digits `D.digit`, and the two checked ingredients
`MeasurableSelectedBlocks.measurable_maxCellDiameter` and
`MeasurableSelectedBlocks.measurable_cellRatio` are available only at a **fixed** index.

This module removes that restriction, by the countable-partition technique that is project
policy for measurable choices (`Forms/MeasurableDirichletConstruction`,
`Corrector/MeasurableBlockMinimizer.measurable_select_of_countable`) and with no measurable
selection theorem.  The observation that makes it work is that `ancestor D s j` reads only
the **finitely many** digits `D.digit (s.1), …, D.digit (s.1 + j - 1)`, each valued in the
four-element type `Fin 2 → Fin 2`.  So for each `j` the parameter space splits into the
finitely many measurable events on which those digits are constant, and on each of them
`ancestor D s j` is a *constant* square index, where `measurable_cellRatio` applies verbatim.

* `ancestorOfWord` is the ancestor computed from an explicit digit sequence, and
  `ancestor_eq_ancestorOfWord` identifies it with `DyadicApproximation.ancestor`;
* `measurable_cellRatio_ancestor`, `measurable_ancestorRatio_index`,
  `measurable_inverseRatio_ancestor`, `measurable_blockIndex_index` and
  `measurable_blockIndex_parent` climb the chain of indices of
  `Geometry/DiameterBlockIndex`;
* `measurableSet_selected` is the conclusion: `{(e, D) | Selected (decode e) D m s}` is
  measurable for **every** real threshold `m` and **every** square index `s`.

`measurableSet_originSelected_of_index` recovers
`MeasurableSelectedBlocks.measurableSet_originSelected` as the special case
`s = originIndex k`, since `MarkedBlockAveraging.OriginSelected F D m k` is by definition
`Selected F D m (originIndex k)`; so the new statement is a strict generalisation of a result
the project already consumes, and in particular its selection events are not empty for
trivial reasons.  For a nonpositive threshold the event *is* empty, and the proof says so
explicitly rather than hiding it.

This is one of the measurability atoms needed to decide block-interpolant existence
measurably; it does **not** address the cell-versus-square incidence labels of a patch, nor
the per-square Dirichlet solvability, which are separate.
