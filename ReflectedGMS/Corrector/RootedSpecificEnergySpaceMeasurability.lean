# Joint measurability of the rooted specific-energy density in the **space** variable

`Corrector/MarkedRootedSpecificEnergyMeasurability.measurable_rootedSpecificEnergyDensity`
proves that `ω ↦ ρ_{Φ(ω)}(H_0)` is measurable: the rooted specific-energy density of a
label-indexed field, read at the **origin**.  Every consumer of
`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.MarkedDensityMeasurability` needs only that.

`Spatial/SpatialMaximalInequality.EnvironmentGrid` needs more.  Its `measurable_density`
field asks for joint measurability of `(ω, z) ↦ ρ_ω(z)` in the environment **and the point**,
because the manuscript's weak-`L¹` maximal inequality `s:eq:maximal` integrates the density
over balls of the plane and then applies Tonelli
(`SpatialMaximalInequality.measurable_ballAverage`).  That is the single input recorded as
open in the docstring of `Corrector/SmallBlockResidualProducer` and in the hypothesis `hjoint`
of `Corrector/SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.measure_densityMaximal_gt_le`; it is the statement
proved here.

## The route

Exactly the slot-sum technique of `Spatial/RootedFiniteEnergyDensityMeasurable` and of
`Corrector/MarkedRootedSpecificEnergyMeasurability`, with the constant point `0` replaced by
an arbitrary measurable point map `Z : Ω → Plane`.  Nothing about the label observable changes,
so `MarkedRootedSpecificEnergyMeasurability.slotSpecificEnergyDensity` and its three lemmas
(`slotSpecificEnergyDensity_of_absent`, `slotSpecificEnergyDensity_eq`,
`measurable_slotSpecificEnergyDensity`) are reused verbatim — the point variable enters only
through

* `rootSlotSetAt`, the event `Z ω ∈ int H_n`, measurable by
  `Spatial.measurableSet_cellInterior`, which is already **jointly** measurable in the cell and
  the point (this is why no new geometry is needed);
* `maskAtPoint`, the event `Z ω ∈ ∂𝓗(E ω)`, the pullback of
  `RootedFiniteEnergyDensityMeasurable.maskSet ⊆ Env × Plane` along `ω ↦ (E ω, Z ω)`.

The disjoint-interiors clause of `Geometry`, which holds at **every** environment, again makes
at most one label qualify, so the slot sum collapses to the root term off the boundary mask.

`measurable_rootedSpecificEnergyDensity_prod` is the product form: instantiating the parameter
space at `Ω × Plane`, with `E`, `Ψ` read through the first coordinate and `Z = Prod.snd`, is
literally the `measurable_density`/`hjoint` shape.  Because the parameter space carries an
arbitrary `MeasurableSpace` instance, it may be instantiated at a **sub**-sigma-field — which
is how `EnvironmentGrid` states its field, and how `Spatial/GoodMarkedSpace` instantiates it.

## Scope

Unconditional, and the field `Ψ` is arbitrary: no harmonicity, no bound, no finite energy, no
mass transport, no moment and no almost-sure hypothesis.  In particular nothing here asserts
that `DyadicApproximation.phi` is measurable — that is the separate assembly input `hmeas`,
and it enters the consumer module only as a hypothesis.  Taking `Z = fun _ => 0` recovers
`MarkedRootedSpecificEnergyMeasurability.measurable_rootedSpecificEnergyDensity`, which is
therefore not reproved but generalised.
