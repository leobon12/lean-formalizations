# The maximum principle on a grid rectangle: interior control from the good grid

This module performs the step of the manuscript's final paragraph of section 6
(`s:eq:sublinear`, subsection "From good lines to all cells") that was left open by
`Corrector/UniformCorrectorSublinearity.lean`:

> Use the full variational maximum principle for `Φ` on `G_{Q'}`. Its boundary coordinates,
> relative to the fixed vector `b_H + c_R`, are bounded by `s:eq:gridchi` and
> `s:eq:boundarycentroid`. Hence, coordinatewise and then in Euclidean norm,
> `|χ(H) - c_R| ≤ 12 α R + o(R)`.

Nothing about the maximum principle is reproved here.  The maximum principle used is the
already checked componentwise statement
`ReflectedGMS.FullEnergyTraceBounds.coord_mem_Icc_of_vector_trace_minimizer_on_component`
for the **full** energy domain and the **full** competition class (every plane-valued
function with the prescribed boundary trace, of finite or infinite energy).  The geometric
confinement used is the already checked
`ReflectedGMS.exists_gridRectangle_of_notMem_gridCells`, and the anchoring of the patch
graph is the already checked `ReflectedGMS.boundaryAnchored_restrictGraph_cells_hitting`.

Three things are supplied here.

* `norm_sub_le_of_vector_trace_minimizer_on_component` — the manuscript's "coordinatewise
  and then in Euclidean norm" step.  If on the boundary component of `x` the corrector
  `Φ - b` is within `ε` of a fixed vector `c` and the reference vectors `b` are within `δ`
  of `b x`, then `‖Φ x - b x - c‖ ≤ √2 (ε + δ)`.  The two coordinate applications of the
  maximum principle are made on the component of `x` only, so no connectedness of the patch
  graph is used.

* `frontier_closedPatch_subset_rectangleFrame` — the spatial boundary of a closed grid
  rectangle is contained in the union of its four closed sides.  This is what converts the
  frame conclusion of `exists_gridRectangle_of_notMem_gridCells` (`every cell meeting the
  frame is a grid cell`) into a statement about `boundaryVertices`, which is the boundary
  set of the anchoring and minimality statements.

* `norm_corrector_sub_le_of_notMem_gridCells` — the actual patch argument: an off-grid cell
  inside the patch obeys `‖Φ H - b H - c‖ ≤ √2 (t + δ)` where `t` is the grid-skeleton
  bound `s:eq:gridchi` and `δ` the centroid bookkeeping `s:eq:boundarycentroid`.  With the
  manuscript's values `t = 3αR + o(R)` and `δ = 2√2 αR + 2 D_{3R}` this is
  `(3√2 + 4) αR + o(R) ≤ 12 αR + o(R)`, the manuscript's display.

The minimality input is `StatementIngredients.FullRectangleMinimizer F Φ`, i.e. exactly the
main-theorem conclusion clause for the harmonic coordinate, applied at the single grid
rectangle produced by the confinement theorem.  It is a hypothesis here: no producer of
that clause for the limiting `Φ` exists in the project yet (the full-rectangle
orthogonality/minimality of the limit is the missing producer), and nothing below assumes
pointwise harmonicity or derives variational minimality from it.  The reference map `b` is
kept abstract with an explicit hypothesis of the shape of `s:eq:boundarycentroid`, so that
the centroid (`cellCentroid`) versus interior-representative distinction is preserved
exactly where the manuscript makes it: the conclusion is about centroids, and passing to
arbitrary representatives `z_H ∈ H` is the separate `s:eq:centroid` step.

/-! ### The maximum principle in vector form on one component -/

/-- **The manuscript's "coordinatewise and then in Euclidean norm" step.**  Let `Φ` be a
full-energy vector trace minimizer with boundary data `u` on `A`, let `b` be an arbitrary
reference map and `c` an arbitrary fixed vector.  If on the boundary of the component of
`x` the corrector `Φ - b` stays within `ε` of `c` and the reference vectors stay within `δ`
of `b x`, then `‖Φ x - b x - c‖ ≤ √2 (ε + δ)`.

The only input is the existing componentwise maximum principle
`FullEnergyTraceBounds.coord_mem_Icc_of_vector_trace_minimizer_on_component`, applied twice
with the two coordinates of the fixed vector `b x + c`. -/
