# `hmeas` for every stage from one per-square measurability statement

`Corrector/BlockInterpolantGateReduction.lean` identifies the block-interpolant existence
event with the per-square solvability event `PatchSolvableEvent m`, at every stage `m ≠ 0`,
and reduces the measurability input `hmeas` of the harmonic-coordinate assembly to a
measurable proxy for that event.  `Corrector/MeasurableSelectedAtIndex.lean` makes every
selection event `{(e, D) | Selected (decode e) D m s}` measurable, at an **arbitrary** square
index `s`.

This module composes the two.  `PatchSolvable F D m` is a conjunction over the countable
index type `SquareIndex` of implications "selected `⟹` solvable", so

  `PatchSolvableEvent m = ⋂ s, (SelectedEvent m s)ᶜ ∪ SquareSolvableEvent s`,

a countable intersection.  The first half of every term is now measurable, so the whole
residual of `hmeas` at the stages `m ≥ 1` is the measurability of the **single per-square
event**

  `SquareSolvableEvent s = {ω | some finite-vector-energy field on the patch of `square ω.2 s`
   carries the centroid trace on that patch's spatial boundary}`,

which does not mention the stage `m`, the skeleton, the gluing, the block index, or the
minimality of any field.  `measurable_gatedApproximant_of_squareSolvability` is the
composite: it produces literally the `hmeas` hypothesis of
`HarmonicCoordinateSevenInputs.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_seven_inputs` from a
measurable candidate family and that one measurability statement.

## Anti-vacuity

`spatialPiBounds_subset_squareSolvableEvent` shows `SquareSolvableEvent s` contains the
manuscript `W`-bound event at every `s`, and `ae_squareSolvable_of_ballBound` shows it is
conull under the project's own spatial maximal bound.  So the event whose measurability
remains open is a.s. the whole space, not a null or empty set, and the identification with
the existence event is a two-sided equality (`BlockInterpolantGateReduction`), not a
one-sided sufficient condition.  The satisfiability argument runs through
`Spatial/AlmostSureSpatialDiameterBounds`, i.e. through the mass-transport and finite-energy
hypotheses of the law, and never through the conclusion.

**This file proves no main theorem and does not certify `hmeas`.**

/-- **The measurability input `hmeas` of the harmonic-coordinate assembly from a measurable
candidate family and measurability of the per-square solvability event.**

The conclusion is literally the `hmeas` hypothesis of
`HarmonicCoordinateSevenInputs.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_seven_inputs`.  Stage `0` is
discharged inside by `BlockInterpolantSelectionGate.isBlockInterpolantSelection_zero`; at the
positive stages the proxy is the solvability event itself, so the agreement hypothesis of
`BlockInterpolantGateReduction.measurable_gatedApproximant_of_patchSolvableProxies` is an
identity.  This is an implication, not a proof of `hmeas`. -/
