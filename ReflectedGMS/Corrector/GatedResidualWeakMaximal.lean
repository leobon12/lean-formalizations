# `s:eq:maximal` for the residual density, with the measurable embedding removed

`Corrector/SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_auxiliaryMarkedSpace` (:422)
and its refinement `Corrector/ResidualDensitySimilarity.markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_similarityEquivariant`
(:160) both transport the project's own weak-`L¹` maximal inequality along a
**measurable embedding** `proj : Ω → MarkedEnvironment`.  That hypothesis is *unsatisfiable*
for the marked space the consumers actually need: the auxiliary second dyadic system of
`s:prop:maximal` forces `Ω` to carry **two** independent uniform grids, and `proj` forgets one
of them, so `proj` is a product projection and no product projection off a nontrivial factor is
an embedding.

`hproj` is used in exactly two places, `:455` (`hproj.map_apply`) and `:459`
(`hproj.lintegral_map`), and in both places only because the *target-side* objects
(`markedResidualMaximal`, `markedSpecificGradientError`) are built from
`DyadicApproximation.phi`, a `Classical.choose`, hence carry no measurability.  This module
removes the embedding by replacing those objects with the **gated residual density**
`gatedResidualDensity`, the left-hand side of the checked
`Corrector/ResidualDensitySpaceMeasurability.residualDensityOf_eq` (:115).  The gated density
is measurable outright, from the assembly's own `hmeas` and nothing else, so both uses become
ordinary `Measure.map_apply` / `lintegral_map` under plain `Measurable proj`; the pathwise gate
that used to relate the two objects becomes an almost-sure gate under `ν ⊗ gridLaw`, and is
*discharged* from the mass-transport and finite-energy hypotheses `hν`, `hFE` that every
downstream consumer already carries
(`SmallBlockResidualProducer.markedSmallBlockResidual_of_weakMaximal`,
`markedCentroidSublinearity_of_weakMaximal`).

## The only new mathematics

`densityMaximal_eq_iSup_rat`: the maximal function of an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued marked density is
already realised along **rational** radii,

  `M(ρ)(ω) = ⨆ q : ℚ, ⨆ _ : 0 < q, r⁻² ∫_{B̄_q} ρ_ω`.

This is the `ℝ≥0∞` analogue of `Spatial/SpatialMaximalInequality.exists_rat_ballAverage` (:463),
which cannot be instantiated here: that lemma is tied to a *real* functional `F` and to the
re-rooting `R` (`ENNReal.ofReal (F (R.shift z ω))`).  The argument is re-run for a general
density, and — this is the point — **on `MarkedEnvironment`**, which is exactly where
`Measure.map_apply` needs its measurable set.  With it, `measurable_densityMaximal` presents
`M(ρ)` as a countable supremum of Tonelli-measurable ball averages
(`SpatialMaximalInequality.measurable_const_mul_setLIntegral`).

## What is DISCHARGED and what is REDUCED

* **REDUCED, not discharged.**  `markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_twoGridSpace` is an implication.
  After it, `MarkedResidualWeakMaximal ν ms` is conditional on exactly one thing: the auxiliary
  **two-grid marked space** `(Ω, R, S, μ, 𝒜)` together with `hprojA`, `hmap`, `hshift`,
  `hdilate`.  This module does not build that space.
* **Discharged here** (were hypotheses of the two existing heads, are now proofs): the
  measurable embedding `hproj`, the pathwise gate `hgood`, and the two measurability
  hypotheses `hmeas0`, `hjoint`.  `hcov`/`hinv` were already discharged upstream in
  `Corrector/ResidualDensitySimilarity`; the four-line ungated core of
  `residualDensityOf_markedSimilarity` (:98–119, read before its two gate rewrites) is re-run
  here for the gated density as `gatedResidualDensity_markedSimilarity`, so no gate is needed
  for them either.
* `hcopies` (`GridIndependenceDifferenceBridge.CopyDifferenceWeakMaximal`) has the identical
  two `hproj` uses at `SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal:523,:530`, and the fix generalises: the
  copy-difference density involves **no `phi` at all** (`firstPotential`/`secondPotential` are
  `markedPotential` at the two grid copies), so its target-side measurability is free from
  `hmeas` and `copyDifferenceWeakMaximal_of_twoGridSpace` drops `hproj`, `hmeas0` and `hjoint`
  with **no new hypothesis**.  Its `hcov`/`hinv` are still open, so `hcopies` remains strictly
  behind `hsub`.

## Anti-vacuity

The constant `C := ENNReal.ofReal 512` is produced **outside** the `∀ m lam` quantifiers — it
is the manuscript's own `512`, inherited from
`Spatial/SpatialMaximalInequality.measure_ballMaximal_gt_le` through
`SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.measure_densityMaximal_gt_le`.  No `δ`-dependent, `m`-dependent or
`lam`-dependent constant occurs.  The gate is not a disguised vacuity: it is almost-sure under
`ν ⊗ gridLaw` and is proved, not assumed, from `hν`/`hFE`
(`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.ae_mem_sublinearEvent` + `ae_marked_of_ae_env`).

# `hcov` and `hinv` for the residual density, along the joint similarity

`Corrector/ResidualDensitySpaceMeasurability` closes the two *measurability* hypotheses of
`SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_auxiliaryMarkedSpace` and lists what is
left (items 4 and 5 of its docstring): the two **pathwise identities**

* `hcov` — re-rooting covariance `ρ_ω(z) = ρ_{ω−z}(0)`, and
* `hinv` — scale invariance `ρ_{S_t ω}(0) = ρ_ω(0)`,

for the residual density `SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.residualDensityOf`.  This module proves the
single concrete identity both are instances of, **with no hypothesis beyond the pathwise gate**:

`residualDensityOf_markedSimilarity` : for every `s > 0`, `u`, `z` and every marked
configuration `p` on `SublinearEvent`,

  `ρ_{markedSimilarity s u hs p}(S(s,u) z) = ρ_p(z)`.

`hcov` is the case `s = 1`, `u = z` (where `S(1,z) z = 0` and
`MarkedMassTransportProducer.markedSimilarity_one` identifies the action with
`ActualMarkedBlockTransport.actualReRooting.shift`); `hinv` is the case `u = 0`, `z = 0`
(where `S(s,0) 0 = 0`).

## Why it is free

The residual field is, on the gate, minus the gradient-error label field of
`Corrector/MarkedBallEnergyConvergence`, whose transport along `markedSimilarity` is
`gradientTransported_gradientErrorLabel` — **ungated**, and with its single hypothesis
`ApproximantGradientCovariantAtEveryStage` discharged outright by
`Corrector/MarkedStageFieldCovariance.covariantAtEveryStage`.  Feeding that into the checked
`Corrector/SpecificEnergyDensitySimilarity.rootedSpecificEnergyDensity_similarity` and reading
both ends through `ResidualDensitySpaceMeasurability.residualDensityOf_eq` gives the identity.
The relabelling is the canonical one,
`Corrector/LabelBijectionProducer.isSimilarityRelabel_similarityRelabel`.

## What is DISCHARGED and what is REDUCED

* The pathwise identity `residualDensityOf_markedSimilarity`, and its two specializations
  `residualDensityOf_shift` / `residualDensityOf_dilate`, are **discharged**: no open input, no
  hypothesis beyond `p.1 ∈ SublinearEvent` (the same gate `ResidualDensitySpaceMeasurability`
  already uses, satisfied at every point of a marked space built over
  `Spatial/GoodMarkedSpace.goodSet`).
* `markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_similarityEquivariant` **reduces** `hcov` and `hinv` for an
  *abstract* marked space `Ω` to the two **equivariance** statements `hshift` / `hdilate`: that
  the embedding `proj` intertwines `R.shift z` with `markedSimilarity 1 z` and `S.dilate t` with
  `markedSimilarity t 0`.  This is not a re-statement of `hcov`/`hinv`: it is a property of the
  *space and its embedding* alone, with the residual density gone, and for a marked space whose
  re-rooting is `ActualMarkedBlockTransport.actualReRooting` and whose embedding is the identity
  it holds by `markedSimilarity_one` and `rfl`.  What this module does **not** do is build that
  marked space — the auxiliary second dyadic system of `s:prop:maximal` — which remains the
  single open producer recorded in `Corrector/SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal`.

# `EnvironmentGrid.measurable_density` for the residual density, and what `hsub` still needs

`Corrector/SmallBlockResidualProducer`'s docstring records **two** obstructions to
instantiating the manuscript's weak-`L¹` maximal inequality `s:eq:maximal` at the residual
density `ρ(φ_m − Φ)`.  The first — translation covariance of the residual field — closed on
2026-09-16 (`Corrector/ApproximantCovarianceFromBlockTransport.phi_similarity`, whose sole
hypothesis is discharged by
`Corrector/BlockInterpolationSimilarity.blockInterpolationSimilarityCovariant`), so that
docstring is stale; `Corrector/SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal` already records the correction.

The second is the subject of this module: **joint measurability of `(ω, z) ↦ ρ_ω(z)` in the
environment and the point**, the `measurable_density` field of
`Spatial/SpatialMaximalInequality.EnvironmentGrid` and, in the form the consumers use it, the
hypothesis `hjoint` of `Corrector/SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.measure_densityMaximal_gt_le`.
It is discharged here, from the assembly's own measurability input `hmeas` and a pathwise
gate.

## What is proved

* `residualDensityOf_eq` — on `HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.SublinearEvent` the residual density
  is the rooted specific-energy density of the **label-indexed** field
  `n ↦ markedDifferenceField ms ω (⟨baseLabel ω.1, n⟩) − gatedApproximant m ω n`, at every
  point `z` of the plane.  This is the standard gate: `DyadicApproximation.phi` is a
  `Classical.choose` and agrees with the measurable `gatedApproximant` only there
  (`MarkedDensityMeasurabilityProducer.phi_eq_gatedApproximant`).
* `measurable_residualDensityOf_prod` — **the target**: for any parameter space with a
  measurable map `proj` into `MarkedEnvironment` whose environment coordinate is gated,
  `(ω, z) ↦ residualDensityOf ms m (proj ω) z` is jointly measurable.  The parameter space's
  sigma-field is arbitrary, so this may be — and below is — instantiated at the
  **sub**-sigma-field `𝒜.sigma` of `EnvironmentGrid`, which is what the consumer asks for.
* `measurable_residualDensityOf_zero` — the same at `z = 0`, which is the consumer's `hmeas0`.
  (At `z = 0` this is not new mathematics: it is the exact-measurability counterpart of
  `MarkedDensityMeasurabilityProducer.aemeasurable_markedSpecificGradientError`, with the
  almost-sure gate replaced by the pathwise one.)
* `markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_gatedMarkedSpace` — `SmallBlockResidualProducer`'s input
  `MarkedResidualWeakMaximal` (which feeds `hsub` through
  `markedSmallBlockResidual_of_weakMaximal` and
  `MarkedCentroidSublinearityProducer.markedCentroidSublinearity_of_smallBlockResidual`) with
  **both measurability hypotheses of
  `SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_auxiliaryMarkedSpace` removed**.

## The gate is satisfiable, and the statement is not vacuous

`mem_sublinearEvent_of_goodEnvironment` : `Spatial/GoodEnvironmentSet.GoodEnvironment e` has
`SublinearDiameterDecay (decode e)` as its second conjunct, which is literally membership of
`SublinearEvent`.  So `Spatial/GoodMarkedSpace.goodSet ⊆ SublinearEvent` and the pathwise gate
`hgood` holds at **every** point of any marked space built over the good set — no almost-sure
hypothesis and no null set.  The gate is therefore not a disguised vacuity: it is exactly the
condition under which `phi` is canonical, and `GoodEnvironmentSet.ae_goodEnvironment` shows the
good set carries full measure under (MTP) and the (FE) moment.

Nor is the conclusion circular: `hjoint` is proved from `hmeas` (measurability of the gated
approximants at each label) and nothing else — not from any maximal inequality, not from
`hspec`, and not from the conclusion `MarkedResidualWeakMaximal`.

## What `hsub` still needs — stated exactly

`markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_gatedMarkedSpace` is an implication and certifies none of its
remaining hypotheses.  After this module they are, verbatim:

1. the marked space itself: `R : MarkedReRooting Ω`, `S : ScaleAction R`, a probability `μ`,
   the environment sigma-field `𝒜`, `hchain : OriginChainRegular R`,
   `hdata : SimilarityBlockData R S μ` and `henv : EnvironmentGrid R μ F₀ 𝒜` — with `R.grid`
   a **second** uniform dyadic system, independent of the pair (environment, interpolation
   grid), as `Corrector/SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal`'s docstring explains.  This module does not
   build it;
2. `hproj`/`hprojA`/`hmap`: the embedding of that space onto `ν ⊗ gridLaw`, measurable for
   `𝒜.sigma`;
3. `hgood`: the pathwise gate (satisfied over the good set, see above);
4. `hcov`: re-rooting covariance of the residual density, `ρ_ω(z) = ρ_{ω−z}(0)`;
5. `hinv`: scale invariance of the residual density at the origin.

Items 4 and 5 are the pathwise identities that
`Corrector/ApproximantCovarianceFromBlockTransport.phi_similarity` and
`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.markedDifferenceField_pairTransport` are expected to supply on
`SublinearEvent`, but the transport of a *density* along `R.shift`/`S.dilate` of an abstract
marked space is a statement about that space and is **not** proved here.  The measurability
half — the subject of this module — is now closed.

/-! ### `hsub`'s maximal input, with no measurable embedding -/

/-- **CONDITIONAL.  `hsub`'s maximal input from a two-grid marked space, with the measurable
embedding, the pathwise gate and both measurability hypotheses removed.**

Compared with `SpecificEnergyWeakMaximal.markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_auxiliaryMarkedSpace` and
`ResidualDensitySimilarity.markedResidualWeakMaximal_of_similarityEquivariant`, the
*unsatisfiable* `hproj : MeasurableEmbedding proj` is gone: only `𝒜.sigma`-measurability of
`proj` is required (ambient measurability follows through `henv.le`).  The pathwise gate
`hgood` is gone too, replaced by the almost-sure gate that `hν` and `hFE` buy — and `hν`, `hFE`
are free, since every consumer of `MarkedResidualWeakMaximal` already carries them.

This is an implication and certifies none of its hypotheses.  What remains open is exactly the
auxiliary two-grid marked space `Ω` together with `hprojA`, `hmap`, `hshift`, `hdilate`; this
module does not build it.  The constant is the manuscript's `512`, fixed before `m` and
`lam`. -/
