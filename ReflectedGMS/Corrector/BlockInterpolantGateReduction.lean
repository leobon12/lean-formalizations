# The block-interpolant gate event is exactly per-square Dirichlet solvability

`Corrector/BlockInterpolantSelectionGate.lean` reduces the measurability input `hmeas` of the
harmonic-coordinate assembly, at every stage `m`, to two things: a measurable candidate field
`Ψ` that is a block interpolant wherever one exists on the good event, and measurability of
the **gate event** `{ω | Ψ ω is a block interpolant at stage m}`.  Stage `0` is closed there;
`m ≥ 1` is not.

This module does two independent things to that residual.

## (1) The gate event may be replaced by *any* measurable set agreeing with existence on the
good event

`isBlockInterpolantSelection_proxy` weakens the second hypothesis of
`BlockInterpolantSelectionGate.isBlockInterpolantSelection_gate` from

  `MeasurableSet (GateEvent m Ψ)` — a measurability statement about the *candidate* —

to

  a measurable `E` with `GoodMarked ∩ E = GoodMarked ∩ ExistenceEvent m`.

Nothing is asked of `E` off the good event, and the candidate `Ψ` no longer has to be
decidable in a measurable way anywhere.  `proxy_of_measurableSet_gateEvent` records that this
is a genuine weakening: the old hypothesis produces such an `E`, namely the gate event
itself, by `BlockInterpolantSelectionGate.gateEvent_inter_sublinearEvent`.

## (2) On `m ≥ 1` the existence event *is* the per-square solvability event

`exists_isBlockInterpolation_iff_patchSolvable` is an unconditional two-sided identity, valid
at every environment because `Code.decode_geometry` supplies `Geometry (decode e)` for free:
for `m ≠ 0`,

  `(∃ f, IsBlockInterpolation F D m f)  ↔  PatchSolvable F D m`,

where `PatchSolvable F D m` says only that **on every `κ`-selected dyadic square** some
plane-valued field on that square's patch has finite vector energy and the centroid trace on
the patch's spatial boundary.  The `⟸` half is
`BlockInterpolantExistence.exists_isBlockInterpolation_of_geometry` (gluing plus the
per-square Dirichlet problem, where `Geometry/BoundaryAnchoring` discharges the anchoring);
the `⟹` half is the observation that a block interpolant restricts on each selected patch to
an admissible competitor.

So the measurability residual of `hmeas` for `m ≥ 1` contains **no gluing, no skeleton
pinning and no minimality quantifier**: those three are exactly what the identity removes.
What is left is one per-square existential over plane-valued patch fields, and
`patchSolvable_iff_coord` splits even that into the two scalar Dirichlet problems that the
project's measurable-minimizer machinery (`Corrector/MeasurableBlockMinimizer`,
`Corrector/MeasurableInfinitePatchMinimizer`) is stated for.

`measurable_gatedApproximant_of_patchSolvableProxies` is the composite: it produces literally
the `hmeas` hypothesis of
`HarmonicCoordinateSevenInputs.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_seven_inputs` from a family
of measurable candidates and a family of measurable proxies for the *solvability* events,
with stage `0` discharged internally by
`BlockInterpolantSelectionGate.isBlockInterpolantSelection_zero`.

## Anti-vacuity

The trap for this packet is a gate event that is measurable because it is empty or null.  It
is neither.  `patchSolvable_of_spatialPiBounds` shows the solvability event contains the
manuscript `W`-bound event, and `ae_patchSolvable_of_ballBound` shows that under the
project's own spatial maximal bound the event is **conull at every stage and every grid**, so
the proxy `E` that a producer must supply is a.s. the whole space, not a null set.  The
reduction in (2) is an *equality* of events proved in both directions, so a producer cannot
discharge it by a one-sided inclusion, and the argument for satisfiability is not circular:
it runs through `SpatialDiameterCellBounds`, which
`Spatial/AlmostSureSpatialDiameterBounds` derives from the mass-transport and finite-energy
hypotheses of the law, never from the conclusion.

**This file proves no main theorem and does not certify `hmeas`.**  For `m ≥ 1` both the
candidate `Ψ` and the measurable proxy `E` remain open.

/-- **A block interpolant restricts to an admissible competitor on every selected patch.**
This is the half of the identity that the existence producer does not give: for `m ≠ 0` the
specification asserts a `CentroidTraceMinimizer` on every selected square, whose first two
clauses are exactly finite patch energy and the centroid boundary trace. -/

free by `Geometry/BoundaryAnchoring`, and the solutions glue.  The `⟹` half is
`patchSolvable_of_exists_isBlockInterpolation`.  No probability, no measurability and no

Compared with `BlockInterpolantSelectionGate.isBlockInterpolantSelection_gate` the
measurability obligation has moved off the candidate: `E` is an arbitrary measurable set that
decides existence correctly *on the good event only*, and is unconstrained elsewhere.  The
proof of the centroid clause is the same as there — off `E` no block interpolant exists, and
the fallback is the centroid field prescribed by the default branch of `phi`. -/
