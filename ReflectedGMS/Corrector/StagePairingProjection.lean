# `MarkedNestedProjectionBound` from one input: the integrable, mean-zero stage pairing

`Corrector/SpecificEnergyConvergence` reduces the assembly input `hspec` to the named input
`SpecificEnergyConvergence.MarkedNestedProjectionBound ν` (:257), the inequality half of the
manuscript's `s:prop:projection`.  Two producer heads existed:

* `Corrector/MarkedStagePythagoras.markedNestedProjectionBound_of_pairing` (:124) — six
  hypotheses: three measurability inputs `hΨmeas`/`hDmeas`/`hPmeas`, the two finiteness inputs
  `hfin : ∀ n, markedStageEnergy ν n ≠ ∞` and `hdfin : ∀ m n, markedStageDefect ν m n ≠ ∞`,
  and the vanishing expected pairing `horth`;
* `Corrector/MarkedStageFieldCovariance.markedNestedProjectionBound_of_gated` (:348) — the same
  bound restated on the gated stage fields; an `↔`, hence a change of coordinates rather than a
  reduction.

This module closes the first head down to **one** input, by removing five of its six
hypotheses:

* `hfin`/`hdfin` are **circular** at every stage `n ≥ 1` — the only producer of
  `markedStageEnergy ν n ≠ ∞` is `SpecificEnergyConvergence.markedStageEnergy_lt_top`, whose own
  hypothesis is the bound being produced, and induction does not help because the identity at
  `(m, n)` needs the finiteness at the *later* stage.  They are eliminated outright by
  `StagePairingPolarization.lintegral_rootedSpecificEnergyDensity_eq_add_of_integrable_pairing`,
  which integrates the polarization in `ℝ≥0∞` with the signed term moved to whichever side makes
  it nonnegative.
* `hΨmeas`/`hDmeas`/`hPmeas` are discharged from the assembly's own measurability input `hmeas`
  through the unconditional engine of `Corrector/MarkedRootedSpecificEnergyMeasurability`, the
  pairing one via the polarization identity
  `StagePairingPolarization.rootedPairingDensity_eq_half_sub`.

## What is proved

* `measurable_gatedStageDensity`, `measurable_gatedStageDifferenceDensity`,
  `measurable_stagePairingDensity` — the three densities of the projection identity are
  measurable from `hmeas` alone, at **every** marked configuration (no gate, no a.e.).
* `gatedStageEnergy_eq_add_gatedStageDefect` — the manuscript identity on the gated fields.
* `MarkedStagePairingVanishes` — the single remaining input: for `m ≤ n` the signed rooted
  pairing density `⟪g_n, g_m − g_n⟫_*` of the gated stage fields is integrable with integral
  zero.
* `markedNestedProjection_of_stagePairing`, `markedNestedProjectionBound_of_stagePairing`,
  `markedSpecificEnergyConvergence_of_stagePairing` — the producers.

## Why the remaining input is not vacuous, and not circular

It is stated on the **gated** stage fields, which are total, unconditionally covariant
(`MarkedStageFieldCovariance.gradientTransported_stageField`) and measurable from `hmeas`; it
mentions no `Summable`, no `HasFiniteEnergy` and no expected energy, so it is satisfiable at
`decode e` data.  Its diagonal instance is a theorem here
(`rootedPairingDensity_stageDifferenceField_self`: at `m = n` the variation vanishes
identically, so the class of laws satisfying the input at that pair of stages is everything),
and it is *not* equivalent to its own conclusion: it is a statement about a signed real
integral, while the conclusion is an inequality between `ℝ≥0∞` energies, and it is precisely
what the owned-field transport chain
(`Corrector/PairingTransportWeld.integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_of_massTransport`,
`Corrector/TransportAeGating.integral_rootedPairingDensity_sub_eq_zero_ae`) is built to
produce.

## What is **not** proved

`MarkedStagePairingVanishes` itself.  This file proves no main theorem, and certifies none of
its inputs.

/-- **The diagonal instance of the pairing input is a theorem.**  At `m = n` the variation
field vanishes identically, hence so does the signed pairing density — at every marked
configuration, with no hypothesis on the law.  So the class of laws satisfying
`MarkedStagePairingVanishes` at a diagonal pair of stages is everything. -/

/-! ### The single remaining input, and the producers -/

/-- **The one remaining input of `hproj`.**  For `m ≤ n` the signed rooted pairing density
`⟪g_n, g_m − g_n⟫_*` of the *gated* stage fields is integrable under the marked law and has
integral zero.  This is the manuscript's blockwise orthogonality transported to the root
(`s:lem:redistribution` applied to `s:prop:projection`).

It carries no `Summable`, no `HasFiniteEnergy` and no expected-energy finiteness, so it is
satisfiable at `decode e` data; its diagonal instance is proved above. -/

almost-sure identification on `SublinearEvent`
