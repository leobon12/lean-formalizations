# Endpoint-spread to owner-block redistribution of a covariant edge coefficient

This module proves the manuscript lemma "Redistribution over blocks"
(`s:lem:redistribution`, manuscript lines 480-498), which is the mass-transport
half of the specific-energy projection `s:prop:projection`.  For a nonnegative
covariant edge coefficient `q_e` which vanishes unless `e` is active for the
selected partition `𝒮_m`, with unique owner block `S_e`, the lemma states

`E[ (2 a_{H_0})⁻¹ ∑_{e ∋ H_0} q_e ] = E[ ℓ(S_m(0))⁻² ∑_{e : S_e = S_m(0)} q_e ]`.

The proof is *not* a deterministic rearrangement of a sum: both sides are rooted
expectations of two different densities, and they are compared through the
manuscript transport

`T(ω, w, z) = ∑_e (q_e/2)(1_{w ∈ H}/a_H + 1_{w ∈ H'}/a_{H'}) 1_{z ∈ S_e}/ℓ(S_e)²`.

What is proved here about this actual transport:

* `OwnedEdgeField.endpointSpreadTransport` is `T` in ordered-label form, with the
  first endpoint only and the coefficient `q_e/2`;
  `OwnedEdgeField.two_mul_endpointSpreadTransport_eq` identifies twice this
  kernel with the manuscript's symmetric two-endpoint form, so the ordered
  convention really is the manuscript one (each unoriented edge is met twice and
  the `/2` convention is preserved);
* `OwnedEdgeField.lintegral_endpointSpreadTransport_outgoing` computes the
  **outgoing** integral `∫ T(ω,0,z) dz`: each owner block has Lebesgue area
  exactly `ℓ(S_e)²` (`volume_halfOpenSquare`), so the block factor integrates to
  one and the outgoing density is the endpoint density at the root cell,
  `OwnedEdgeField.rootEndpointDensity`;
* `OwnedEdgeField.lintegral_endpointSpreadTransport_incoming` computes the
  **incoming** integral `∫ T(ω,z,0) dz`: the endpoint factor integrates to one
  because a cell with null frontier has `volume (interior H) = a_H`
  (`Spatial.volume_interior_eq_of_frontier_null`), and the origin lies in the
  owner block `S_e` exactly when `S_e` is the selected origin block `S_m(0)`.
  The latter is the geometric heart: distinct *selected* squares have disjoint
  half-open squares (`eq_of_selected_of_mem_halfOpenSquare`), proved from
  half-open dyadic nesting together with the checked
  `ActiveBlockEdges.not_selected_ancestor_of_selected`.  So the incoming density
  is `OwnedEdgeField.ownerBlockDensity`;
* `OwnedEdgeField.endpointSpreadTransport_shift` is the **covariance** of the
  kernel under re-rooting, derived from the relabelling equivariance of the
  coefficient and of the owner block (`OwnedEdgeField.ReRootingCovariant`), i.e.
  from the manuscript hypothesis that `q` is a covariant coefficient of scaling
  degree two and `S_e` is covariantly defined.  The kernel then has the exact
  degree `-2` homogeneity of `EnvironmentLaws.MassTransportKernel` in the
  translation direction used by the marked transport.

The single probabilistic input is the mass-transport identity for the **one**
kernel `OwnedEdgeField.endpointSpreadTransport`; it is *not* proved here and is
the explicit producer dependency of this module.  On the actual marked
configuration space `Env × Grid` it is discharged from the manuscript's own
`s:eq:MTP` by
`MarkedMassTransportProducer.markedMassTransport_of_massTransport`.

The whole-class predicate `MarkedMassTransport` is still defined below, but see
its audit note: its covariance clause is only the `C = 1` instance of
`s:eq:Tcov`, so it is strictly stronger than `s:eq:MTP` and is not a manuscript
hypothesis.  No result here depends on it any more.  The final identity itself is
never assumed.

* `OwnedEdgeField.lintegral_rootEndpointDensity_eq_lintegral_ownerBlockDensity`
  is the nonnegative redistribution identity `s:eq:redistribute`;
* `integral_signedRootDensity_eq_integral_signedOwnerDensity` is the signed
  extension, obtained from the positive and negative parts.  Following the
  manuscript it is stated **only** under finiteness of the expected endpoint
  density of `|q_e|`; no global finite-energy assumption is used, and the
  specific energy remains an expected root density.

Following the manuscript, the signed identity is obtained from the positive and
negative parts and is stated **only** under finiteness of the expected endpoint
density of `|q_e|`, i.e. of the two nonnegative expected endpoint densities.  No
global finite-energy hypothesis is used: the specific energy remains an expected
root density. -/
