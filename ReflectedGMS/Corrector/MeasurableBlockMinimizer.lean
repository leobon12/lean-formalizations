# Measurable anchored minimizers on a *varying* finite block with a *varying* boundary

`Forms/MeasurableDirichletConstruction.lean` produces a measurable field of anchored
Dirichlet minimizers for one **fixed** finite vertex type and one **fixed** finite anchor
set: `MeasurableDirichletConstruction.exists_measurable_anchored_minimizer`. The actual
blockwise harmonic coordinates of the manuscript are not of that shape. The labels of a
selected dyadic block and the labels of its boundary skeleton both move with the
environment, so the finite system itself — its vertex set, its matrix size and its anchor
set — is random.

This module removes that restriction. The only structure used is that a finite label set
is a `Finset` of a countable label type, so the pair (block labels, boundary labels) takes
countably many values: the parameter space is partitioned into the countably many
measurable events on which the finite system is constant, and on each event the already
checked explicit finite solution `MeasurableDirichletConstruction.anchoredSolution` of the
nonsingular Dirichlet system applies verbatim. No measurable selection theorem is used and
no continuity in the data is assumed; the conductances, the connectivity pattern, the block
and the boundary may all vary arbitrarily and measurably.

The results are:

* `blockSolution`, the anchored minimizer of the restricted graph on a finite label set
  `s` with anchors the labels in `b`, extended off the block by the reference function, and
  `blockSolution_spec`, its trace, interior discrete harmonicity and *restricted energy*
  minimality — the last stated with `FiniteDirichletEnergyLimit.restrictedEnergy`, i.e. in
  exactly the form consumed by the canonical exhaustion machinery
  (`FiniteDirichletEnergyLimit.tendsto_levelEnergy_of_tendsto_pointwise`), so that the
  varying-block minimizers of a varying exhaustion can be fed to the pointwise limit;
* `exists_measurable_varying_block_minimizer`, the same conclusions for measurably varying
  `S B : Ω → Finset V`, together with measurability of the field, vertex by vertex and into
  the product;
* `exists_measurable_varying_block_minimizer_anchorSet`, the form actually needed by a
  truncation: the boundary is an arbitrary measurable **set**-valued anchor family
  `A : Ω → Set V` (a skeleton is not given as a finset), traced onto the block through
  `anchorFinset`, and the anchoring hypothesis and the conclusions are stated with
  `AnchoredFiniteExhaustion.inducedAnchorSet`.

What is *not* proved here: nothing is claimed about infinite block patches, about the
measurability of the selected block labels or of the anchor labels themselves (these are
hypotheses `hS`, `hB`, `hA`), and nothing is claimed for plane-valued fields.

/-- **Measurable anchored minimizers on a varying finite block with a varying boundary.**

For conductance data and reference data depending measurably on a parameter, and for a
block `S ω` and boundary label set `B ω` which vary measurably among the countably many
finite label sets, there is a *measurable* field of functions which, at every parameter
value, carries the prescribed values at the boundary labels of the block, is discrete
harmonic in the restricted graph at every other label of the block, minimizes the
restricted Dirichlet energy among all functions with those boundary values, and is the
reference function outside the block.

The only pointwise hypothesis is that the restricted graph is anchored at the induced
boundary set; the conductances, the connectivity pattern, the block and its boundary may
all vary arbitrarily. -/
