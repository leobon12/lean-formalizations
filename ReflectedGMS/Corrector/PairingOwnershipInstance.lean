# The actual ownership datum of the signed pairing coefficient, and its block sum

`Corrector/OwnedFieldPairingTransport` reduces the manuscript's

`∫ ω, rootedPairingDensity (decode (R.env ω)) (Ψ ω) (H ω) 0 ∂μ = 0`

to a structural datum `PairingOwnership R m Ψ H` — a symmetric, selected-square-valued owner
label for every ordered pair of raw vertex labels, absent only where the signed coefficient
vanishes — together with two real-valued hypotheses on the owner block of the origin
(`hsum`, `hzero`).  No producer existed for either.  This module supplies both, for the
**actual** nested pair, out of results already checked in this project:

* `activeOwner` — the owner block of an ordered pair of vertices is the unique selected square
  of which it is an `ActiveBlockEdges.ActiveEdge`.  Uniqueness is the checked
  `ActiveBlockEdges.activeEdge_unique`; nothing new is assumed.
* `activePairingOwnership` — the resulting `PairingOwnership`.  Its only nonformal field is
  *"the coefficient vanishes on unowned pairs"*, which is proved, not assumed: if the pair is
  not an edge the conductance is `0`; and if it is an edge, the two cells meet, so by the
  manuscript's `NestedProjectionProducers.SelectionCoversOn` some selected square contains a
  common point — which is covered, being in a cell — and hence both endpoints, and failure of
  `ActiveEdge` for that square then
  forces both endpoints onto its spatial boundary, where the variation `H` vanishes.
* `summable_indicator_ownedByOriginBlock` and `tsum_indicator_ownedByOriginBlock_eq_zero` —
  the two remaining real-valued hypotheses `hsum`/`hzero`, discharged from the block-local
  data of the manuscript's projection: `Ψ ω` minimizes the vector energy on the selected
  origin block against the centroid trace, and the competitor `Ψ ω + H ω` has finite
  block-local energy.  These are exactly the hypotheses of the checked
  `NestedProjectionProducers.summable_vectorGradProd` and
  `NestedProjectionProducers.tsum_vectorGradProd_sub_eq_zero_of_centroidTraceMinimizer`
  at the origin block; **no** finite energy of the whole network is used.
* `integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_of_active` — the transport statement with the
  ownership instance supplied and `hsum`/`hzero` gone.

The bridge between the `ℕ × ℕ`-indexed owner block and the `patchVertices × patchVertices`
index of the checked producers is the injection `labelPair` together with
`Function.Injective.summable_iff` and `Function.Injective.tsum_eq` (mathlib).  A mathlib search
(`grep` on statement shape over the pinned tree) found those two, `Set.indicator_of_notMem`
and `Real.inner_apply`; it found no form of the ownership construction, of the active-edge
owner, or of the label reindexing, and the project's own `ReflectedGMS/` tree contains no
`PairingOwnership` producer and no indicator-reindexing adapter (searched for
`Injective.tsum_eq`, `support_indicator_subset`, `summable_indicator`, `activeOwner`,
`labelOwner`, `PairingOwnership`).

* `ae_notMem_boundaryMask_env` — the hypothesis `hbdry` as well: the marked mass-transport
  principle already required pushes forward to the environment law along `R.env`, because a
  `MassTransportKernel` is similarity-covariant and the re-rooting action translates the
  environment, and the checked `Spatial.ae_notMem_boundaryMask_of_massTransport` then applies.

What is **not** proved here: the marked mass-transport principle `MarkedMassTransport` (a
separate, adjudicated packet), the measurability hypotheses `hcoeff`/`howner`, the pathwise
origin selection `hsel`, the re-rooting equivariance `PairingReRooting`, and the a.e.
finiteness of the two expected endpoint densities.  All of these remain visible hypotheses of
`integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_of_active`, which is therefore a **conditional**
statement and certifies none of its inputs.

/-! ### Reindexing an indicator sum along an injection

The owner block of the origin is a set of ordered *label* pairs, while every checked block
result is indexed by ordered pairs of *patch vertices*.  The two sums agree as soon as the
label map is injective, its range covers the owner block, and the coefficient vanishes at the
patch pairs outside the owner block. -/

really translates the environment. -/

/-- **`hbdry`.**  Almost surely the origin lies on no cell boundary, from the manuscript's own
mass-transport principle `s:eq:MTP` for the pushed-forward environment law, through the checked

The hypothesis is `EnvironmentLaws.MassTransport (μ.map R.env)` — the manuscript's `s:eq:MTP`
read on the law of the environment observable — and **not** the marked principle
`SpecificEnergyRedistribution.MarkedMassTransport`, which is strictly stronger than `s:eq:MTP`
and is not derivable from it.  The translation property `hre` of the re-rooting action is
consequently no longer needed either. -/
