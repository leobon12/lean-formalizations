# `hconv` from the stage-difference weak-`L¹` maximal inequality

This module discharges `Corrector/MarkedDifferenceSubsequence.MarkedDifferenceIncrementsSummable`
— hence, through `markedDifferencesConverge_of_summable`, the input `hconv`
(`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.MarkedDifferencesConverge`) of the harmonic-coordinate assembly —
from the *same* single open input that `Corrector/StageDifferenceWeakMaximal` uses for `hpatch`:
`MarkedStageDifferenceWeakMaximal`, the manuscript's `s:eq:maximal` at the specific-energy
density of a stage difference.

## The missing step, and what supplied it

`hpatch` needs only *energy* convergence on bounded patches, and
`StageDifferenceWeakMaximal.hasCauchyPatchEnergy_of_geometric_ballMaximal` delivers that.  `hconv`
needs the *pointwise* statement: at every pair of labels, the difference
`φ_{ms j}(H_b) − φ_{ms j}(H_a)` converges.  The classical route from energy to pointwise control
is the anchored-walk estimate, and the project has it —
`Forms/FiniteMinimizerPointwiseConvergence.abs_sub_le_walkConst_mul_restrictedEnergy` — but stated
for a **real** field and the **real** `restrictedEnergy`, whereas every patch bound in the
corrector programme is an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued `vectorEnergy` of a `Plane`-valued field.  No bridge
between the two existed anywhere in the three trees.  `Corrector/RestrictedEnergyBridge` is that
bridge; this module is its first consumer.

## The chain

1. `exists_pos_radius_walk_support_hits` — a walk has finite support and every cell is compact,
   so the union of the cells along a walk lies in a closed ball.  Consequently the walk support
   is contained in `hittingVertices F (B̄_R)` for some `R > 0`: the "walk support is bounded"
   step, and it costs nothing beyond compactness of cells.
2. `summable_norm_increments_of_geometric_ballMaximal` — the pathwise heart, at one fixed
   `IndexedCells` and with the maximal function abstracted into a bare sequence `Mf : ℕ → ℝ≥0∞`
   (the same hoisting `StageDifferenceWeakMaximal` uses; inlining `decode ω.1` into the calc
   blocks provokes `whnf` heartbeat timeouts).  `Geometry` supplies a walk between any two
   vertices, step 1 supplies the patch, `s:eq:localcontrol` bounds the patch energy by
   `(R + D_R)² · 2^{-2i}`, and the bridge turns that into
   `‖Δ_i(b) − Δ_i(a)‖ ≤ C · 2^{-i}`, which is summable.
3. `markedDifferenceIncrementsSummable_of_stageDifferenceWeakMaximal` — the marked assembly, the
   exact analogue of `markedPatchEnergyCauchy_of_stageDifferenceWeakMaximal`: Borel–Cantelli at
   the level `2^{-2j}` against the geometric rate of the subsequence, one almost-sure event for
   all labels at once (the Borel–Cantelli threshold `N` is a functional of the environment, not
   of the label pair, so the label quantifier stays *inside* the almost-sure statement without
   any further countability argument).

Note the direction of the gain: the almost-sure event does not depend on `k`, so the conclusion
is genuinely `∀ᵐ ω, ∀ k`, which is what `MarkedDifferenceIncrementsSummable` asks.

## Anti-vacuity

* Every hypothesis is realised at the actual data.  `hgeom` is produced outright by
  `Corrector/SpecificEnergyConvergence.exists_strictMono_geometric_markedStageDefect`;
  `exists_strictMono_markedDifferencesConverge_of_weakMaximal` below composes them, so hypothesis
  and conclusion are **jointly** realisable.
* `MarkedStageDifferenceWeakMaximal` is not vacuous and not a "uniform constant" trap: the
  project proves the same display with the absolute constant `512`
  (`Spatial/SpatialMaximalInequality.measure_ballMaximal_gt_le`), and the constant here is merely
  existentially quantified and required finite.  See `StageDifferenceWeakMaximal`'s docstring.
* No hypothesis of the form `∀ n, markedStageEnergy ν n ≠ ∞` is used anywhere below, so the
  circular satisfiability argument flagged for `Corrector/MarkedStagePythagoras`'s `hfin` is not
  imported.  The string `markedStageEnergy` does not occur in this file.
* The walk hypothesis of the bridge is satisfiable for **every** pair of vertices, not just some:
  step 1 proves it unconditionally from compactness of cells, so the pointwise conclusion covers
  every paired label, which is exactly the quantifier `hconv` needs.
* **The join is machine-checked.**  `hconv_join_shape_check` partially applies the consumer
  `Corrector/HarmonicCoordinateSevenInputs.harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_seven_inputs` to the
  producer of this file in the `hconv` slot (and to `StageDifferenceWeakMaximal`'s producer in the
  `hpatch` slot); if it elaborates, the shapes genuinely match.

## What is still open

`MarkedStageDifferenceWeakMaximal` itself, and `MarkedNestedProjectionBound` (only in the
satisfiability corollary, where it produces the subsequence).  This file proves no main theorem.

# `MarkedDifferencesConverge` by diagonal extraction (`s:prop:limit`, pointwise half)

`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.MarkedDifferencesConverge ν ms` is the `hconv` input of
`harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_named_inputs`.  Unfolded, it says that for almost every
marked environment `ω` **every** paired label converges along `ms`:

  `∀ k, ∃ c, Tendsto (fun j => differenceApproximant ms j ω k) atTop (𝓝 c)`,

and on the good event `SublinearEvent` the approximant at `k = Nat.pair a b` is exactly the
manuscript's `φ_{ms j}(H_b) − φ_{ms j}(H_a)`.

## The structural point

The assembly quantifies over `ms` **universally**: `hconv` is asked of a subsequence that is
handed to it.  No producer can supply that, because the manuscript's proof of `s:prop:limit`
*constructs* the subsequence — it is the output of an energy-compactness argument, not an
input to it.  The honest target is therefore the **existential** form

  `∃ ms, StrictMono ms ∧ MarkedDifferencesConverge ν ms`,

which is what `exists_strictMono_markedDifferencesConverge` below produces.  This does **not**
match the `∀ ms` shape of `harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_named_inputs`, and
`harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_compactness` records exactly the adapter that is needed: a
producer of the nine remaining inputs must supply them *for whatever subsequence the
compactness argument returns*, i.e. in the `∀ ms, StrictMono ms → MarkedDifferencesConverge ν
ms → …` form, rather than for a subsequence fixed in advance.

## What is proved here and what is assumed

Proved outright (no hypothesis beyond the two named inputs below):

* `exists_strictMono_ae_limitGood` — the **diagonal extraction**.  From a labelwise
  refinement property ("every subsequence of the stages admits a further subsequence along
  which the approximants at *one* given label converge almost surely") it produces a *single*
  deterministic strictly increasing subsequence along which *every* label converges almost
  surely.  This is the nested-extraction-plus-diagonal step; it is the only place where the
  countability of the label set `ℕ` is used, through `MeasureTheory.ae_all_iff`.
* `markedDifferencesConverge_of_summable` — the quantitative route: almost-sure summability
  of the increments along a **given** `ms` gives `MarkedDifferencesConverge ν ms` for that
  same `ms`, by the Cauchy criterion and completeness of `Plane`.  Unlike the extraction, this
  one *does* match the assembly's `∀ ms` shape, so it is the cheapest honest producer whenever
  the subsequence has already been pinned down by a rate.

Assumed (named, atomic, and not certified anywhere in this file):

* `MarkedLabelSubsequentialCompactness ν` — relative sequential compactness, for almost-sure
  convergence at each single paired label, of the family of difference approximants.  Its
  intended producer is the uniform energy bound on the interpolants (the first conjunct of
  `MarkedSpecificEnergyConvergence`, i.e. `sup_m E[ρ(φ_m)] < ∞`) together with the usual
  Banach–Alaoglu/Mazur extraction and the passage from convergence in measure to almost-sure
  convergence along a subsequence.  Nothing in the checked corpus supplies it;
  `Corrector/MinimizerStrongGradientConvergence` does **not**, since its index is an
  exhaustion level of one fixed graph with one fixed boundary datum, whereas `phi F D m` are
  block interpolants at successively finer dyadic scales with the competitor class changing
  with `m`.
* `MarkedDifferenceIncrementsSummable ν ms` — the summable-increment input of the second
  route.

**This file proves no main theorem** and certifies neither named input.

/-- **A walk meets only a bounded region of the plane.**  Its support is a finite list of
vertices, each cell is compact, and a finite union of compact sets is compact, hence bounded.
So every vertex of the walk lies in the patch `ℍ(B̄_R)` of some radius `R > 0`.

This is the only geometric input needed to apply the anchored-walk estimate on a *patch*: no
connectivity, no diameter bound and no mass transport. -/

/-! ### The pathwise summability -/

/-- **The pathwise heart.**  At one fixed cell family, with the maximal function abstracted into
a bare sequence `Mf`, geometric decay of the ball integrals of the successive stage-difference
densities makes the increments of *every* pairwise difference absolutely summable.

The proof: `Geometry` gives a walk from `a` to `b`; the walk support sits in a patch `ℍ(B̄_R)`
by `exists_pos_radius_walk_support_hits`; `s:eq:localcontrol`
(`Corrector/SpecificEnergyLocalControl.vectorEnergy_hittingVertices_le_ballMaximal`) bounds the
patch energy of the increment by `(R + D_R)² · 2^{-2i}`; and
`Corrector/RestrictedEnergyBridge.norm_sub_le_of_vectorEnergy_le` converts that patch energy
bound into the pointwise bound `C · 2^{-i}` along the walk.  Geometric, hence summable.

No measure and no good event occur: this is a statement about one `IndexedCells`. -/
