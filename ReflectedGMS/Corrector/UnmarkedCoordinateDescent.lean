# Measure-theoretic descent to an environment-only harmonic coordinate

This file is the **measurability half** of manuscript Proposition `s:prop:gridindependence`
("The auxiliary grid disappears", `sections/05.tex` lines 52-71):

> Given `ℍ`, take independent grids `𝒟₁, 𝒟₂` ... Conditional on `ℍ`, two independent copies
> thus agree almost surely. To make the measurability conclusion without assuming moments of
> the vertex values, encode the real coordinates by their arctangents, with zero at unused
> cell labels. For any one coordinate `Z`, conditional independence gives
> `E[(Z¹ − Z²)² ∣ ℍ] = 2 Var(Z¹ ∣ ℍ) = 0`.
> Thus each bounded coordinate is `ℍ`-measurable. Inverting arctangent and using the countable
> cell coding proves that the entire gradient and normalized potential are `ℍ`-measurable.
> There is also an exactly covariant version. ...

`Corrector/HarmonicGridIndependence.lean` already proves the *comparison* half (the two coupled
grids produce a.s. equal potentials, from the four specific orthogonality relations). That
equality is kept here as the explicit hypothesis `hcopies`; **nothing in this file claims that
grid independence has been produced**, only that it descends.

## What is proved

The conditioning on `ℍ` is realised concretely: the joint law of the environment and the two
independent grids is `ν.prod (σ.prod σ)` on `Env × (Grid × Grid)`, so conditioning on `ℍ` is
evaluation at a fixed `e : Env` and the conditional variance is `Var[·; σ]`.

* `integral_sq_sub_prod_eq_two_mul_variance` — the manuscript's identity
  `E[(Z¹ − Z²)²] = 2 Var(Z)` for a bounded measurable coordinate on the independent product,
  proved by Fubini (`integral_prod_mul`) and `ProbabilityTheory.variance_eq_sub`.
* `ae_eq_integral_of_ae_prod_eq` — two independent copies that agree a.s. have zero variance
  (via the identity above) and are therefore a.s. equal to their own mean. This is the exact
  step `E[(Z¹ − Z²)² ∣ ℍ] = 2 Var(Z¹ ∣ ℍ) = 0` followed by "each bounded coordinate is
  `ℍ`-measurable"; boundedness is what makes the mean available without moment assumptions.
* `unmarkedValue` — the descended field: the arctangent code of each real coordinate of each
  cell label is averaged over the grid and the arctangent is inverted. It is measurable in the
  environment alone (`measurable_unmarkedValue`) and it is a genuine *inverse* of the coding on
  the point masses (`unmarkedValue_eq_of_ae_eq`).
* `ae_ae_eq_unmarkedValue` — **the descent**: if the two independent grid copies give the same
  field almost surely, then for a.e. environment the marked field is a.s. equal to the
  environment-measurable field `unmarkedValue`.
* `unmarkedCellField`, `exists_unmarked_cellField` — packaged as the `EnvironmentFields.CellField`
  that `HarmonicMainStatement.IsHarmonicCoordinate` quantifies over: measurable on `Env`, zero at
  absent labels, a.s. equal to the marked field.
* `DescentGood`, `descentField`, `descentCellField` — the manuscript's last paragraph: the set of
  environments whose grid-conditional law is a point mass is measurable and has full measure, the
  field is taken to be that point mass there and zero elsewhere, and this unmarked field transports
  exactly under any measure-preserving grid action of a similarity (`GridTransfer`), hence the good
  set is similarity invariant (`similarityInvariant_descentGood`) and the field is covariant
  (`descentField_covariant`).

## Scope

The grid-equivariance data (`GridTransfer` / `SimilarityGridEquivariant`) and the independent-copy
equality (`hcopies`) are hypotheses: they are owed by the grid-dilation producer
(`Geometry/UniformGridDilationInvariance`) and by the remaining harmonic-energy inputs of
`Corrector/HarmonicGridIndependence` respectively. No harmonicity, energy, or convergence property
is used or asserted anywhere below: this is exactly the measure-theoretic descent.
