# Joint measurability of the endpoint-spread to owner-block transport

`ReflectedGMS.Corrector.SpecificEnergyRedistribution` proves the manuscript
lemma "Redistribution over blocks" (`s:lem:redistribution`) for the actual
transport

`T(ω, w, z) = ∑_e (q_e/2)(1_{w ∈ H}/a_H + 1_{w ∈ H'}/a_{H'}) 1_{z ∈ S_e}/ℓ(S_e)²`

of an `OwnedEdgeField`, but leaves two hypotheses of its final identity
`lintegral_rootEndpointDensity_eq_lintegral_ownerBlockDensity` undischarged: the
*joint* measurability `hmeas` of the kernel on `Ω × Plane × Plane`, and the
covariance `ReRootingCovariant`.  This module discharges the first one outright
and reduces the second to label-level data.

Nothing here assumes the transport, or any of its integrals, measurable.  The
inputs are the structural ones:

* `henv`/`hgrid`: the environment and dyadic-grid observables of the marked
  re-rooting are measurable — the same two hypotheses already used by
  `ReflectedGMS.Spatial.MarkedBlockAveraging`;
* `hweight`: each ordered-pair coefficient `ω ↦ q_e(ω)` is measurable;
* `howner`: each *selected ownership* event `{ω | S_e(ω) = s}` is measurable.

The route is:

* the label cell of a raw slot is the slot's compact cell (`slotCellSet`,
  `labelCell_eq_slotCellSet`), so the already checked joint measurability of
  cell interiors and cell volumes on the Hausdorff-Borel space of compact cells
  (`ReflectedGMS.Spatial.measurableSet_cellInterior`,
  `ReflectedGMS.Spatial.measurable_cellVolume`) transfers to the label cells and
  gives the joint measurability `measurable_spread_uncurry` of the endpoint
  factor `1_{w ∈ int H_n}/a_{H_n}`;
* the owner-block factor is handled by decomposing over the *countable* set of
  square indices: `measurableSet_ownerSetGraph` writes the graph of the owner
  block as a countable union over `s` of `{ω | S_e = s}` intersected with the
  half-open-square graph, and `ownerArea_eq_tsum` writes the owner area as a
  countable sum of indicators, each measurable because the grid coordinates are
  (`measurable_squareLower`, `measurable_squareUpper`, `measurable_gridSide`);
* `measurable_endpointSpreadTransport` then follows from
  `Measurable.ennreal_tsum` over the countable index `ℕ × ℕ`, preserving the
  `q_e/2` convention of the manuscript kernel verbatim.

Two further results are proved:

* `measurable_rootEndpointDensity` — the manuscript endpoint density
  `(2 a_{H_0})⁻¹ ∑_{e ∋ H_0} q_e` is measurable in `ω`.  This is one of the
  `AEMeasurable` inputs of the *signed* redistribution
  `SpecificEnergyRedistribution.integral_signedRootDensity_eq_integral_signedOwnerDensity`,
  and its proof (`rootEndpointDensity_eq_tsum`) uses that at most one cell
  interior contains the origin, so the boundary convention of the density is
  preserved exactly;
* `reRootingCovariant_of_ownerReRooting` — the kernel covariance
  `OwnedEdgeField.ReRootingCovariant`, which is stated in terms of the *sets*
  `ownerSet` and the areas `ownerArea`, follows from the label-level equivariance
  `OwnerReRooting`: a relabelling `σ` of the raw labels together with a
  reindexing `τ` of the selected squares under which the owner label, the
  coefficient, the cells and the half-open squares are equivariant.  This is the
  actual ownership half of the covariance; the equivariance of the environment
  and grid laws themselves remains the producer dependency and is *not* claimed
  here.

Combining, `lintegral_rootEndpointDensity_eq_lintegral_ownerBlockDensity_of_structural`
is the redistribution identity whose only remaining inputs are the mass-transport
identity for the single kernel `Q.endpointSpreadTransport`, the label-level
equivariance, and the origin-selection hypothesis.  It does **not** take the
whole-class predicate `SpecificEnergyRedistribution.MarkedMassTransport`, which
is strictly stronger than the manuscript's `s:eq:MTP`; see the audit note on that
definition and the unconditional producer
`MarkedMassTransportProducer.markedMassTransport_of_massTransport`.
