# Unique block ownership of the active edges of a selected dyadic block

This module supplies the combinatorial input of the specific-energy projection
chain `e_m + ‖g_m - g_0‖² = e_0` for the *actual* objects of
`ReflectedGMS.Geometry.DyadicApproximation`: the `κ`-selected squares
`Selected F D m s`, the patches `patchVertices F (square D s)`, the spatial
boundaries `boundaryVertices F (square D s)` and the `skeleton`.

The blockwise interpolation `phi` is characterised by minimising the vector
energy on each selected block against every competitor with the centroid trace.
Turning the resulting blockwise minimality into a single global statement
requires knowing that the variations carried by different blocks do not
interact, i.e. that every edge carrying a nonzero zero-boundary variation is
owned by *at most one* selected block.  That is what is proved here.

The geometric chain is:

* `interior_carrier_subset` — the interior of a closed axis-parallel rectangle
  in the Euclidean plane consists of the strictly interior points;
* `notMem_square_of_mem_interior_of_same_level` — two lattice squares of the
  same level with different lattice offsets meet only through the boundary of
  either one;
* `blockIndex_le_blockIndex_parent` / `blockIndex_ancestor_monotone` — `κ` is
  *unconditionally* monotone along an ancestor chain, because `b` is
  (`DiameterBlockIndex.inverseRatio_ancestor_mono`).  This strengthens
  `DiameterBlockIndex.selected_ancestor_unique`, which assumed strict
  monotonicity, to `not_selected_ancestor_of_selected`;
* `notMem_square_of_mem_interior_of_selected` — hence two *distinct* selected
  squares are never nested and their interiors meet no point of the other;
* `mem_boundaryVertices_of_mem_two_selected` — a *cell* (not a point) that
  meets two distinct selected squares must meet the spatial boundary of each of
  them, by connectedness of the cell; this is the actual ownership statement,
  and it holds without any finite cell-count assumption.

The edge conclusions are then:

* `activeEdge_unique` — an edge active in a selected block is active in no
  other selected block;
* `vectorGradSq_eq_zero_of_mem_two_selected` — an edge owned by two distinct
  selected blocks contributes zero to the energy of any variation vanishing on
  the skeleton;
* `tsum_tsum_activeWeight` and `tsum_tsum_activeWeight_le` — the exact
  redistribution of nonnegative (`ℝ≥0∞`-valued) edge weights over the selected
  blocks.  These are stated for arbitrary nonnegative edge weights, and
  `vectorEnergy_eq_tsum_vectorGradSq` identifies the actual vector energy as
  half such an edge sum, so the redistribution applies to it directly.  No
  integrability hypothesis is needed because every term is nonnegative; a
  signed redistribution is *not* claimed here.
