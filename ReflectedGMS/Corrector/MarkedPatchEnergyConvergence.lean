# `MarkedPatchConvergence` from an approximant-level input (`s:prop:limit`(d))

`HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.MarkedPatchConvergence ν ms` is the `hpatch` input of
`harmonicCoordinateConclusions_of_named_inputs`, and it is consumed by
`Corrector/MarkedRectangleHarmonicity.markedHarmonicity_of_approximant_orthogonality`.
Unfolded, it says that for almost every marked environment and **every** bounded spatial set
`A` the vector Dirichlet energy, on the patch graph of the cells hitting `A`, of the error
`φ_{m_j} − Φ` tends to zero.

## Why `hconv` alone does not give it

`hconv = MarkedDifferencesConverge` gives convergence of `φ_{m_j}(H_b) − φ_{m_j}(H_a)` at
each single pair of labels.  The patch energy, however, is a `tsum` over the ordered pairs of
a possibly **infinite** vertex set `{v | Hits (decode ω.1) A v}` (the patch is not assumed
finite anywhere in this project), so termwise convergence of the edge contributions is not
enough: one extra, genuinely analytic, input is needed.  This file isolates exactly that
input, in two interchangeable forms, and proves the passage to the limit from it.

## What is proved here

Everything except the two named inputs.  In particular the *termwise* half is discharged
outright from `hconv`: `tendsto_phi_difference` shows that on the good event `SublinearEvent`
and at a marked environment in `LimitGood` the differences `φ_{m_j}(w) − φ_{m_j}(v)` converge
to `Φ(w) − Φ(v)`, using the cocycle identity `isDifferenceField_markedDifferenceField` to
rewrite `Φ(w) − Φ(v)` as the value of the marked difference field at the paired label
`⟨v, w⟩`.  `SublinearEvent` is not optional: off it `markedPotential ms ω = 0` while
`φ_m ≠ 0`, so the conclusion is false there; its almost-sure occurrence is the checked
`ae_mem_sublinearEvent`, which is why `hν` and `hFE` appear.

Two analytic routes are supplied, both stated for an **arbitrary** conductance graph and an
arbitrary (possibly infinite) vertex set, with no finite-support or finite-patch assumption:

* `tendsto_vectorEnergy_sub_zero_of_cauchy` — **Fatou**.  If the patch energies of the
  differences `φ_j − φ_k` are Cauchy, the patch energy of `φ_j − Φ` tends to zero.  The
  mechanism is Fatou's lemma for `ℝ≥0∞`-valued series (`tsum_le_liminf_tsum_of_tendsto`,
  obtained from `MeasureTheory.lintegral_liminf_le` against the counting measure on
  `W × W`): for fixed `j`, `E(φ_j − Φ) ≤ liminf_k E(φ_j − φ_k) ≤ ε`.
* `tendsto_vectorEnergy_sub_zero_of_dominated` — **dominated convergence**.  If the ordered
  edge contributions of `φ_j − Φ` admit one summable dominating bound, the patch energy tends
  to zero.  This is `MeasureTheory.tendsto_lintegral_of_dominated_convergence` against the
  counting measure on `W × W`, packaged as `tendsto_tsum_of_dominated`.

The bridge making both possible is `vectorEnergy_eq_tsum_patchEdgeEnergy`: the vector energy
of the statement file *is* the `ℝ≥0∞` series `∑' p : W × W, patchEdgeEnergy G h p` of its
ordered-pair contributions, with no summability hypothesis on either side.

## The Cauchy input is *equivalent* to the target, the domination input is stronger

`markedPatchEnergyCauchy_of_markedPatchConvergence` proves the converse of the Fatou route:
`MarkedPatchEnergyCauchy` follows from `MarkedPatchConvergence` by the elementary quadratic
bound `E(x − y) ≤ 2E(x − z) + 2E(z − y)` (`vectorEnergy_sub_le`).  So the Fatou route replaces
`hpatch` by an *equivalent* statement which no longer mentions the limit `markedPotential ms ω`
at all — it is a statement about the concrete block interpolants `phi` only, in the same style
as `MarkedRectangleHarmonicity.MarkedApproximantRectangleOrthogonality`.  Nothing has been
weakened and nothing smuggled in.  `MarkedPatchEdgeDomination`, by contrast, is genuinely
stronger than the target and still mentions the limit; it is recorded because it is the
shortest route whenever a rate is available.

**This file proves no main theorem** and certifies neither named input.
