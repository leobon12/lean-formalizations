# The coupling bridge for `s:prop:gridindependence`

`Corrector/HarmonicGridIndependence.lean` proves the *comparison* half of the manuscript
proposition `s:prop:gridindependence` ("The auxiliary grid disappears"), and
`Corrector/UnmarkedCoordinateDescent.lean` proves the *measurability* half.  The two halves do
not compose, for a purely structural reason:

* `HarmonicGridIndependence.ae_eq_of_specificPairing_orthogonal` is stated for a **fixed**
  countable vertex type `V` and a family `F : Ω → IndexedCells V`;
* the actual environment space has an **environment-dependent** vertex type,
  `Code.decode e : IndexedCells (Code.Vertex e.val)` with `Code.Vertex r = {n // (r.1 n).isSome}`;
* and the descent of `UnmarkedCoordinateDescent` consumes its input in the product shape
  `∀ᵐ p : Env × Grid × Grid ∂ν.prod (σ.prod σ), Ψ (p.1, p.2.1) = Ψ (p.1, p.2.2)`
  on `ℕ`-indexed label fields.

So `ae_eq_of_specificPairing_orthogonal` cannot be instantiated at `Ω := Env × Grid × Grid`,
`μ := ν.prod (σ.prod σ)` at all: there is no single `V`.  Padding `V := ℕ` with degenerate cells
is not available either, because `Geometry` demands both `(⋃ v, cell v) = univ` and connectedness
of the cell-adjacency graph, which isolated absent labels destroy.

This module supplies the missing bridge.  It runs the manuscript's comparison chain directly on
the joint law `μ` of the environment and the two independent grid copies, with the vertex type
depending on the sample point, and then converts the resulting `Code.Vertex`-indexed equality into
the `ℕ`-indexed product shape that `UnmarkedCoordinateDescent` consumes.

## Reuse

Nothing in the comparison chain is reproved.  The pointwise algebra of the polarized
specific-energy density is `V`-polymorphic in `HarmonicGridIndependence`, so it applies at each
sample point with that point's own vertex type, and is used verbatim:
`rootedSpecificPairingDensity_sub_self`, `rootedSpecificPairingDensity_self_nonneg`,
`ofReal_specificPairingDensity_self`, `eq_of_forall_specificPairingDensity_self_eq_zero`.  Only
the *integral* steps, which involve no vertex type once the pointwise identity has been applied,
are redone here — they are three lines of `integral_add` / `integral_sub`.
The manuscript's "detects every edge" step is the checked
`SpecificEnergyLocalControl.apply_eq_of_setLIntegral_closedBall_eq_zero`.

## What is proved

* `eq_of_forall_vertex_eq` — two `ℕ`-indexed label fields with the absent-label zero convention
  agree as soon as they agree at every present label.
* `ofReal_rootedSpecificPairingDensity_self` — the rooted form of
  `HarmonicGridIndependence.ofReal_specificPairingDensity_self`: the diagonal of the rooted
  polarized density is the project's rooted specific-energy density `ρ_Φ`.
* `specificPairingDensity_self_eq_zero_of_setLIntegral_closedBall_eq_zero` and
  `eq_of_setLIntegral_closedBall_sub_eq_zero` — the manuscript's
  "`s:eq:localcontrol` on integer-radius disks then detects every edge and makes its value zero",
  in the exact form in which `HarmonicGridIndependence` needs it.  This *proves* the hypothesis
  `htransfer` of `ae_eq_of_specificPairing_orthogonal` from the vanishing of the disk integrals.
* `rootedPairing`, `rootedPairing_sub_self`, `integral_rootedPairing_sub_self_eq_zero`,
  `ae_rootedPairing_self_eq_zero`, `lintegral_rootedSpecificEnergyDensity_origin_eq_zero` — the
  manuscript's `‖g¹ − g²‖²_sp = 0` chain, on the joint law, with a sample-dependent vertex type.
* `lintegral_origin_eq_zero_of_orthogonality` — that chain packaged: the four cross orthogonality
  relations alone, with **no** stationarity, anchoring or maximal inequality, make the expected
  rooted specific-energy density of `g¹ − g²` at the origin vanish.
* `ae_setLIntegral_closedBall_eq_zero` — the passage from the vanishing of the expected rooted
  density at the origin to the almost-sure vanishing of every disk integral, under the spatial
  stationarity identity `hstationary` (see "Inputs" below), and
  `ae_setLIntegral_closedBall_eq_zero_of_ballMaximal` — the same passage along the manuscript's
  own maximal-function route, in the shape produced by `Spatial.SpatialMaximalInequality` and
  `Spatial.ActualSpatialDensityBridge.setLIntegral_le_ballMaximal`.
* `ae_eq_of_ae_setLIntegral_closedBall_eq_zero` and `ae_eq_of_orthogonality` — the assembled
  comparison: `∀ᵐ p ∂μ, g₁ p = g₂ p`.
* `aeProd_marked_copies_of_orthogonality` — **the bridge**: the same conclusion in the exact
  product shape `∀ᵐ p : Env × Grid × Grid ∂ν.prod (σ.prod σ), Ψ (p.1, p.2.1) = Ψ (p.1, p.2.2)`
  that `UnmarkedCoordinateDescent.exists_unmarked_cellField` consumes.
* `exists_gridIndependent_cellField` — the composition with that consumer: an environment-only
  measurable `CellField` which is almost surely the marked field.

## Inputs — this is an honestly CONDITIONAL result

Nothing here proves grid independence outright.  Three families of inputs stay visible as named
hypotheses, each owed by a different packet:

1. `h₁ … h₄` with `hi₁ … hi₄` — the four cross specific-orthogonality relations of the manuscript
   and their integrability.  These are exactly the inputs of
   `HarmonicGridIndependence.specificPairing_sub_self_eq_zero`, transcribed to the joint law.
   Owed by `Corrector/LimitingHarmonicPotential` and `Corrector/SpecificEnergyRedistribution`.
2. `hstationary` (and its measurability side condition `hballMeasurable`) — the spatial
   stationarity/Palm identity
   `E ∫_{B̄_r} ρ_θ(z) dz = |B̄_r| · E ρ_θ(0)`.
   This is a symmetry property of the law alone: it holds for *every* field and asserts nothing
   about `θ` vanishing.  It is the manuscript's mass-transport step.  **It is not currently
   available in the project in this form**: `EnvironmentLaws.MassTransport` is a whole-plane
   outgoing = incoming identity for degree `(-2)` similarity-covariant kernels, and the ball form
   used here has no producer.
3. `hanchor` — the manuscript's normalization, that the two potentials agree at one cell of each
   sample (the root cell `H₀`).

No harmonicity, minimality, or convergence property is used or asserted anywhere below.
