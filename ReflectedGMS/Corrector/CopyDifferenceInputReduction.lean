# `hcopies` from **three** inputs instead of ten

`Corrector/GridIndependenceDifferenceBridge.differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_orthogonality`
reduces `hcopies = HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.DifferenceFieldGridIndependent ν ms` to **ten**
open inputs: the four cross specific-orthogonality relations `h₁ … h₄` against an arbitrary
reference field `g₀`, their four integrability conditions `hi₁ … hi₄`, the integrability `hint`
of the self-pairing of the difference, and the weak-`L¹` maximal inequality
`CopyDifferenceWeakMaximal`.

This module cuts that list to **three** — one integrability condition, one orthogonality
relation and the unchanged maximal input — by three observations, none of which touches the
mathematics of the route:

1. **`hint` is free.**  `GridIndependenceCoupling.rootedPairing_sub_self` is a *pointwise*
   identity, valid at every sample point and every `g₀`: the self-pairing of the difference is
   `(A₁ − A₂) + (A₃ − A₄)` where `Aᵢ` are the four cross integrands.  Integrability of the four
   therefore gives integrability of the self-pairing, with no new hypothesis
   (`integrable_rootedPairing_diff_self`).  This is
   `Corrector/HarmonicGridIndependence.integrable_rootedSpecificPairingDensity_sub_self`
   transported to the sample-dependent vertex type of the coupled space.
2. **The reference field may be taken to be the first potential.**  `g₀` is universally
   quantified in the bridge, so it may be instantiated at `g₀ := firstPotential ms`.  Then the
   first and fourth cross pairings are pairings against the identically zero field, so `hi₁`,
   `hi₄`, `h₁` and `h₄` all hold outright (`rootedPairing_self_sub`).
3. **The two surviving relations are exchanged by the grid swap.**  The coupled law
   `ν ⊗ (gridLaw ⊗ gridLaw)` is invariant under `swapGrids : (e, D₁, D₂) ↦ (e, D₂, D₁)`
   (`measurePreserving_swapGrids`, from `Measure.measurePreserving_swap` — the two grid copies
   are i.i.d.), and `swapGrids` exchanges `firstPotential` with `secondPotential` *definitionally*
   (`firstPotential_swapGrids`).  Hence the third cross integrand is, after the swap, the negative
   of the second (`crossPairing_swapGrids`), and `hi₃`/`h₃` follow from `hi₂`/`h₂`.

## The three remaining inputs

`differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_cross_orthogonality`:

* `hi` — integrability of `p ↦ ⟪∇θ¹, ∇(θ² − θ¹)⟫(p)` on the coupled law;
* `horth` — the manuscript's cross orthogonality `∫ ⟪∇θ¹, ∇(θ² − θ¹)⟫ = 0`;
* `hmax` — `GridIndependenceDifferenceBridge.CopyDifferenceWeakMaximal ν ms`, unchanged.

Here `θ¹ = firstPotential ms` and `θ² = secondPotential ms` are the two grid-copy marked
potentials.

## Anti-vacuity: what `horth` actually is

`integral_rootedPairing_diff_self_eq` proves, from `hi` alone,

  `∫ ⟪∇(θ¹ − θ²), ∇(θ¹ − θ²)⟫ = −2 ∫ ⟪∇θ¹, ∇(θ² − θ¹)⟫`.

Since the left-hand side is pointwise nonnegative
(`HarmonicGridIndependence.rootedSpecificPairingDensity_self_nonneg`), `horth` is **exactly**
the vanishing of the expected specific energy of the difference at the origin — no more and no
less.  So the collapse `10 → 3` is an honest bookkeeping reduction and not a weakening: the
original ten inputs were jointly *stronger* than what the route consumes (they pinned four
cross pairings separately), and the three below are jointly *equivalent* to the origin step
`GridIndependenceCoupling.lintegral_origin_eq_zero_of_orthogonality` plus the maximal step.

Two consequences worth recording for whoever proves `horth`:

* `horth` cannot be obtained by any argument that does not, at bottom, prove
  `‖∇θ¹ − ∇θ²‖²_sp = 0`; conversely nothing weaker than `horth` suffices along this route.
  The manuscript's proof of it is the full variational orthogonality of each limiting potential
  over the *other* grid's blocks, which is **not** the local free-orthogonality identity
  `Corrector/LimitingPotentialFreeOrthogonality.dirichletForm_limit_eq_zero`: the latter is
  restricted to variations vanishing off a bounded rectangle, and `θ² − θ¹` does not vanish off
  a bounded set.
* `hi` is the only remaining *integrability* condition of the whole bridge.  By the termwise
  bound `2|⟪a,b⟫| ≤ ‖a‖² + ‖b‖²` of
  `Corrector/SpecificEnergyPolarization.integrable_rootedPairingDensity` it follows from
  finiteness of the two expected origin specific energies `E ρ_{θ¹}(0)`, `E ρ_{θ²}(0)` together
  with the corresponding measurability; the grid swap makes those two quantities equal, so it is
  really one finiteness statement.  That reduction is not carried out here because the
  measurability half is `hmeas`, owned elsewhere.

**This file proves no main theorem.**  The three remaining inputs are open; every statement
below is an implication.  The weld to the six-input assembly is machine-checked by the
partial-application `example` at the end.
