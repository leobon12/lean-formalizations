# The two owner-block densities of a signed edge coefficient agree

`Corrector/SpecificEnergyRedistribution` attaches to every `OwnedEdgeField` its manuscript
owner-block density

`ownerBlockDensity Q ω = (2 ℓ(S_m(0))²)⁻¹ ∑_{e : S_e = S_m(0)} q_e`,

an `ℝ≥0∞` quantity.  `Corrector/OwnedFieldPairingTransport` builds, out of the *signed*
manuscript pairing coefficient `q_e = c(e) ⟪Ψ(e), η(e)⟫`, the two owned edge fields
`posField`/`negField` whose weights are `ofReal (±q_e)`, i.e. literally the positive and the
negative part of `q_e`, and its transport statements carry the deterministic blockwise
orthogonality as the single hypothesis

`∀ ω, (posField O).ownerBlockDensity ω = (negField O).ownerBlockDensity ω`.

This module discharges that hypothesis from the **real-valued** statement that the signed block
edge sum vanishes, which is the shape of the checked
`NestedProjectionProducers.tsum_vectorGradProd_nested_eq_zero`
(*"their sum on every block is zero by orthogonality"*).

## What is actually proved

The mathematics is `q⁺ − q⁻ = q`, which is mathlib's `max_zero_sub_max_neg_zero_eq_self`.  The
content of this module is the **`ENNReal`/real transfer** and its side conditions, which are
not formal:

* real `tsum` of a non-summable family is the junk value `0`, so a bare `∑ q_e = 0` carries no
  information without summability; and
* `ENNReal` subtraction is truncated, so the step from `∑ q⁺ − ∑ q⁻ = 0` to `∑ q⁺ = ∑ q⁻`
  must be taken in `ℝ`, where it needs both partial sums to be finite.

Summability of `q` on the owner block is therefore taken as an explicit hypothesis.  It is
*not* an extra assumption in the eventual application: it is exactly the conclusion of the
checked `NestedProjectionProducers.summable_vectorGradProd`, whose own hypotheses are the two
**block-local** energies.  Nothing here uses finite energy of the whole network, and nothing
here assumes any transport identity.

## Contents

* `max_zero_le_abs`, `max_neg_zero_le_abs`, `summable_max_zero`, `summable_max_neg_zero` —
  the two parts of a summable real family are summable;
* `tsum_max_zero_eq_tsum_max_neg_zero` — a summable real family with vanishing sum has equal
  positive- and negative-part sums;
* `tsum_ofReal_eq_tsum_ofReal_neg` — the same statement transferred to `ℝ≥0∞`;
* `ownerBlockDensity_eq_of_tsum_eq_zero` and its `∀ ω` form
  `forall_ownerBlockDensity_eq_of_tsum_eq_zero` — the consumer statement, for **any** two
  owned edge fields carrying the same owner labels and the two parts of one real coefficient.

Mathlib supplies `max_zero_sub_max_neg_zero_eq_self` (`q⁺ − q⁻ = q`), `Summable.abs`
(unconditional summability of a real family is absolute summability) and
`ENNReal.ofReal_tsum_of_nonneg`; an `exact?` search of the imported environment found no
mathlib form of the two summability adapters or of the transfer itself.
`ofReal_eq_ofReal_max` lives here rather than in `Corrector/OwnedFieldPairingTransport` so
that both modules share one copy; the latter imports this file and keeps using it unqualified.

variable {Ω : Type*} [MeasurableSpace Ω] {R : MarkedReRooting Ω} {m : ℝ}

/-- **The deterministic blockwise orthogonality, in the `ℝ≥0∞` shape the redistribution
needs.**  Let `Qp` and `Qm` be two owned edge fields with the *same* owner labels, whose
weights are the positive and the negative part `ofReal (±f p)` of one real coefficient `f`.
If `f` is summable on the owner block `S_m(0)` of the origin and its sum there vanishes, the
two manuscript owner-block densities coincide.

Both denominators are the same number `2 ℓ(S_m(0))²`, so this is an identity of numerators;
the whole content is the real/`ENNReal` transfer of `tsum_ofReal_eq_tsum_ofReal_neg`.  Nothing
about any transport identity, any measure, or any measurability is used. -/
