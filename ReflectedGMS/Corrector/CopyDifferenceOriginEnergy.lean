# `hcopies` from **two** inputs, and the consistency of that pair

`Corrector/GridIndependenceDifferenceBridge` reduces `hcopies` to ten inputs and
`Corrector/CopyDifferenceInputReduction` collapses those to three.  The count is really **two**:
the whole cross-orthogonality block exists only to produce the single `ℝ≥0∞` statement

  `hzero : E[ ρ_{θ¹ − θ²}(0) ] = 0`

(the expected rooted specific-energy density of the difference of the two grid-copy potentials at
the origin), which together with the maximal input `CopyDifferenceWeakMaximal` already gives
`hcopies` through the bridge's own `differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_ae_disk` and
`ae_disk_eq_zero_of_weakMaximal`.

`differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_originEnergy` records that two-input form.  Its advantage over
the three-input form is not only the count: `hzero` is an `ℝ≥0∞` statement, so it carries **no
integrability side condition at all**, whereas the Bochner route must assume `hi`.

## The routes, and how they relate

* `originEnergy_eq_zero_of_cross_orthogonality` — the Bochner route: `hi` and `horth` of
  `Corrector/CopyDifferenceInputReduction.differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_cross_orthogonality`
  give `hzero`.  So the three-input theorem factors through the two-input one, and the ten-input
  bridge factors through the three-input one.  Nothing in this chain is circular: each step only
  discards hypotheses that the pointwise polarization identity or the grid swap already supplies.
* Any other proof of `hzero` — for instance one that never leaves `ℝ≥0∞` — plugs into
  `differenceFieldGridIndependent_of_originEnergy` directly.

## Anti-vacuity

The pair `(hzero, hmax)` is **consistent**: `originEnergy_eq_zero_of_ae_eq` and
`copyDifferenceWeakMaximal_of_ae_eq` prove both of them, with the explicit constant `C = 1`, from
the almost-sure equality of the two grid-copy potentials.  So neither hypothesis is
self-contradictory and neither is `⊥` in disguise — the failure mode of
`Limit/RootBlockGridProbability`'s `hdata`, whose hypothesis was unsatisfiable at the actual data,
does not occur here.

**This witness is deliberately reported as weak, and the reason is worth recording.**  It
establishes consistency only in the situation the conclusion itself describes.  That is not an
artefact of these two statements: by
`Corrector/CopyDifferenceInputReduction.integral_rootedPairing_diff_self_eq` and the pointwise
nonnegativity of the self-pairing, `hzero` *is* the vanishing of the expected specific energy of
`θ¹ − θ²`, which is the entire mathematical content of the origin step.  Any reduction of
`hcopies` along this route therefore has a hypothesis that is equivalent to the difficult half of
the conclusion; the real work is the manuscript's cross orthogonality, and no amount of further
bookkeeping will remove it.  What the reduction *does* buy is that a prospective proof now has a
single, integrability-free target.

**This file proves no main theorem.**
