# The pairing ownership datum with a *cover-or-vanish* gate, and its two measurability inputs

`Corrector/PairingOwnershipInstance.activePairingOwnership` needs
`hcover : ∀ ω, SelectionCoversOn (decode (R.env ω)) (R.grid ω) m` at **every** configuration in
order to *construct* the `PairingOwnership` datum, and
`Corrector/TransportAeGating` records that this is the one thing it could not gate.  On the
actual marked space `Env × Grid` that hypothesis is false at a general `ω`
(`Corrector/StagePairingSkeletonData` proves it only on `SublinearEvent`), and the recorded
remedy was to re-instantiate the whole transport chain on the good subtype.

**That re-instantiation is unnecessary.**  `hcover` enters the construction through exactly one
step, `PairingOwnershipInstance.coeff_eq_zero_of_no_active_owner`, which concludes that the
signed coefficient `c(e) ⟪ΔΨ, ΔH⟫` vanishes on an unowned edge.  Where the *variation* `H`
vanishes identically that conclusion is free.  So the cover hypothesis may be relaxed to

  `∀ ω, ¬ SelectionCoversOn … → ∀ v, H ω v = 0`,

which is satisfied by every field that is **gated by the good event**, and in particular by
`MarkedStageFieldCovariance.stageDifferenceField` (both stage fields are `0` off
`SublinearEvent`, by `HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.gatedApproximant_of_notMem`).

## What is proved

* `gatedPairingOwnership` — the ownership datum in cover-or-vanish form, for an arbitrary
  `MarkedReRooting`.  Its owner is the canonical `PairingOwnershipInstance.labelOwner`, by
  `rfl` (`gatedPairingOwnership_owner`).
* `ownedByOriginBlock_subset_range_of_owner`, `pairCoeff_labelPair_eq_zero_of_notMem_of_owner`,
  `summable_indicator_ownedByOriginBlock_of_energies`,
  `tsum_indicator_ownedByOriginBlock_eq_zero_of_orthogonality` — the block data `hsum`/`hzero`
  of `Corrector/TransportAeGating.integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_ae` for **any**
  ownership datum whose owner is `labelOwner`; the corresponding results of
  `PairingOwnershipInstance` are stated only for `activePairingOwnership` and are therefore
  unusable here.  The orthogonality form takes the bare block pairing `⟪Ψ, H⟫_{G_S} = 0`.
* `measurableSet_labelOwner_eq_some` — the open input `howner` of
  `Corrector/PairingTransportWeld`: the `some c` fibre of the owner label is the `ActiveEdge`
  event, a Boolean combination of the selection event
  (`MeasurableSelectedAtIndex.measurableSet_selected`), the conductance slot, and the patch and
  boundary label events of `Corrector/PatchLabelMeasurability`.
* `measurable_pairCoeff_of_labels` — the open input `hcoeff` of the same weld, for any two
  label-indexed fields.

## What is **not** proved

Nothing here concludes any transport identity, and no main theorem is proved.  The block-local
energies feeding `summable_indicator_ownedByOriginBlock_of_energies` and the block orthogonality
feeding `tsum_indicator_ownedByOriginBlock_eq_zero_of_orthogonality` are visible hypotheses.

# The two structural data of the pairing ownership, on the good event

`Corrector/TransportAeGating` records, as the one thing it could **not** gate, that
`PairingOwnershipInstance.activePairingOwnership` needs its two structural hypotheses at every
`ω`, because they are used to *construct* the `PairingOwnership` datum rather than to prove
something about it:

> `hcover` (a `SelectionCovers` hypothesis) and `hH` at every `ω` … Gating those two is a
> separate piece of work.

and `Corrector/NestedProjectionProducers` says of `SelectionCoversOn` that it

> is **not** proved here; it is strictly weaker than, and says nothing about, the pinning
> conclusion below.

**Both are available on the good event, and the covering statement is not an open input at
all.**

* `SelectionCoversOn (decode e) D m` for `m > 0` is *verbatim* the conclusion of the checked
  `Spatial/NonmacroscopicSelectedBlocks.exists_selected_mem`, whose hypotheses are
  `Geometry` (free, `Code.decode_geometry`), `SublinearDiameterDecay (decode e)` — which is
  the *definition* of `HarmonicCoordinateAssembly.SublinearEvent` — and, since the covering
  clause of `Geometry` was weakened to `μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0`, that the point be covered.
  So `hcover` holds at every point of the good subtype `SublinearEvent × Grid`, with no new
  mathematics.  This corrects the recorded "not proved here": the producer exists, one
  `Spatial/` module away.
* `hH` — the pinning `s:eq:pinnested` for the *nested* pair — follows on the same event from
  `NestedProjectionProducers.skeleton_subset_skeleton_of_le` (which consumes exactly the
  covering statement above) together with the pinning clause of
  `DyadicApproximation.IsBlockInterpolation`.

## Consequence for the architecture

The pairing weld
(`Corrector/PairingTransportWeld.integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_of_massTransport`) must
therefore be instantiated on the **good subtype** `Spatial/GoodMarkedSpace.goodSet × Grid`
(where `goodSet ⊆ SublinearEvent`), not on `Env × Grid`: on the good subtype `hcover` is a
theorem, and `hH` costs only the existence of block interpolants.  This is the same move the
project already made for `OriginChainRegular` in `Spatial/GoodMarkedSpace`.

## What is **not** proved

The existence of block interpolants `∃ f, IsBlockInterpolation (decode e) D k f`, which is the
separately staffed `hmeas`-lane atom (per-square Dirichlet solvability); it is a visible
hypothesis of `phi_eq_cellCentroid_on_skeleton` and
`stageDifferenceField_eq_zero_on_skeleton`.  This file proves no main theorem.

/-! ### The covering statement on the good event -/

/-- **`SelectionCoversOn` is the good event.**  Every **covered** point of the plane lies in a
square selected at any positive parameter, as soon as the environment has sublinear diameter
decay — i.e. as soon as `e ∈ SublinearEvent`.  Nothing else is used: `Geometry` is free at a
decoded environment.

The restriction to covered points is the manuscript's own (§3.1) and is not removable: the
covering clause of `Geometry` only asks `μH[1] (uncoveredSet F) = 0`, and the block index of a
square is controlled only through the cells its patch meets, so no square through an uncovered
point need ever be selected. -/
