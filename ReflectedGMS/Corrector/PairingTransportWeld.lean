# The signed pairing transport with the transport identities supplied

`Corrector/OwnedFieldLabelTransport` discharges all four clauses of
`MarkedMassTransportProducer.SimilarityCovariantField` and of
`OwnedFieldPairingTransport.PairingReRooting` for the actual ownership datum.  This module spends
them: it removes **four** of the hypotheses of
`PairingOwnershipInstance.integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_of_active`, the transport
statement behind the `horth` input of `Corrector/MarkedStagePythagoras`.

* `markedMassTransport_endpointSpreadTransport` — the mass-transport identity `hmtp`/`hmtm` for
  the endpoint-spread/owner-block kernel of **any** owned edge field, from
  `EnvironmentLaws.MassTransport ν` (the project's faithful `s:eq:MTP`) alone plus the field's
  own measurability and its `SimilarityCovariantField`.  The chain is the checked
  `endpointSpreadTransport_markedSimilarityCovariant` (tex:497, "this has scaling degree `-2`")
  followed by `markedMassTransport_of_massTransport`; what was missing was the covariance
  hypothesis, which is now a theorem.
* `massTransport_map_env_prod` — `hν` for the marked law `ν ⊗ gridMeasure`, because its first
  marginal is `ν`.
* `integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_of_massTransport` — the weld.  Compared with
  `integral_rootedPairingDensity_eq_zero_of_active`, the hypotheses `hmtp`, `hmtm`, `hν`, `henv`,
  `hgrid` and `hrr` are gone.

## What remains open in the weld

`hcover`, `hH` (the two structural data of `activePairingOwnership`), the two measurability
inputs `hcoeff`/`howner`, the pathwise origin selection `hsel`, the two finiteness inputs
`hpfin`/`hmfin`, and the block-local minimality `hmin`/`hmE`.  None of these is proved here;
they are all visible hypotheses, so the conclusion is **conditional** and certifies none of its
inputs.  In particular this file does **not** prove `horth`, and does not prove
`SpecificEnergyConvergence.MarkedNestedProjectionBound`.
