# One-dimensional Hausdorff-null subsets of the plane are Lebesgue-null

The singular-set manuscript assumes `H¹(Ssing) = 0` for the uncovered set (Definition 1.1(ii)).
Every argument that only needs "the cells cover Lebesgue-almost every point" consumes that
hypothesis through the implication proved here.

The proof is the standard dimension comparison: `μH[1] s = 0` forces `dimH s ≤ 1 < 2`, so
`μH[2] s = 0`; and on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)` the measure `μH[2]` is an additive Haar measure
(`Mathlib/Geometry/Euclidean/Volume/Measure.lean`), so `volume` is a scalar multiple of it by Haar
uniqueness.

No measurability of `s` is required: both steps are statements about outer measures.
