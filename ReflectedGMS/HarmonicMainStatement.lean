The full harmonic-coordinate main statement, manuscript Theorem `s:thm:main`.
This file defines the proposition to be proved; it does not provide its proof.
Every construction and convergence witness is in the conclusion. The only
random-law assumptions are almost-sure geometric validity, full mass transport,
and the FE moment condition. In particular there is no ergodicity assumption.

The physical similarity relation is the existing relation on canonically
labelled environments. The canonical relabeling action is a total, single-valued,
measurable group action (proved since this file was written: `exists_isSimilarity`,
`IsSimilarity.target_unique`, `measurable_similarityActionEnv`), so the covariance and
mass-transport clauses quantify over exactly the manuscript's similarities.
