/-! # A genuine two-sided reflected path law on a constant-step time grid

The actual reflected process of `ReflectedWalk.IsReflectedWalk` is only defined
for nonnegative times.  Here a two-sided (`ℤ`-indexed) path is built from **two
independent copies** of the process started at the same vertex: the first copy
reads the nonnegative times, the second copy reads the negative times.  This is
the standard construction of a two-sided stationary path for a reversible
Markov process, and it is carried out here for the *fixed starting vertex* law
`twoSidedStartLaw` and for the speed-weighted mixture `twoSidedSpeedLaw`.

The proved content is:

* `measurable_twoSidedPath`: the two-sided path map is measurable, so the laws
  `twoSidedVertexLaw` and `twoSidedGridLaw` on `ℤ → Option V` exist;
* `twoSidedStartLaw_twoSidedCylinder_real` and
  `twoSidedSpeedLaw_twoSidedCylinder_real`: the exact finite-dimensional
  cylinder mass of a window `[-p, q]` crossing time `0`, as a forward product
  and a backward product of full-form semigroup kernels;
* `twoSidedSpeedLaw_twoSidedCylinder_real_leftStart`: the **reversible** form of
  that mass, i.e. the backward half is turned around by detailed balance, so the
  window mass is exactly the one-sided grid weight started at the left endpoint
  `v (-p)`.  This is what makes the two-sided object a genuine stationary
  reversible law rather than two glued one-sided laws;
* `twoSidedSpeedLaw_twoSidedCylinder_shift` and
  `twoSidedGridLaw_map_twoSidedShift_twoSidedCylinder`: time-shift invariance of
  the law on these cylinders.

Scope warning.  The speed function `m` here carries the hypothesis
`Summable m`: it is the **temporary summable fast speed** used by the existing
full-form semigroup identities (`semigroupKernel`, detailed balance,
`reflected_gridEvent_start_real`), and it is *not* the area speed measure of the
mass-transport statement.  Transferring these cylinder identities to the area
speed requires the time change from the fast clock to the area clock, which is
not proved anywhere here; nothing in this file proves an area-law temporal mass
transport principle.  Likewise no ordinary annealed stationarity, no finite
total area assumption and no abstract stationary-law hypothesis is used: the
law is constructed from the actual process family.  Canonical
environment-dependent measurability and the spatial-to-temporal transport
remain separately open.
