/-! # The temporal mass-transport identity from time-shift invariance

This file proves the *temporal* half of the manuscript lemma `p:lem:timeMTP`
("Temporal mass transport"): for a transport kernel `W (ω, s, t) ≥ 0` that is
covariant under time shifts,

```
  W (θ r ω) (s - r) (t - r) = W ω s t,
```

the **outgoing** and **incoming** transports agree,

```
  ∫ ∫_ℝ W ω 0 t dt dQ(ω) = ∫ ∫_ℝ W ω t 0 dt dQ(ω),
```

whenever the underlying trajectory measure `Q` is invariant under every
deterministic time shift `θ r`.  This is exactly the step of the manuscript
proof that reads

> "For each deterministic `t`, shift the sigma-finite measure
> `Q_H = ∑_v a_v P_H^v` by `t`.  The last expression equals
> `E_H^o ∫_ℝ V(Ω,-t,0) dt = E_H^o ∫_ℝ V(Ω,s,0) ds`.  Tonelli justifies all
> exchanges."

Scope, stated exactly.

* `Q` is **only** assumed σ-finite (`SFinite`), never a probability measure and
  never of finite total mass: the intended `Q` is the area-biased σ-finite path
  mixture `∑_v a_v P_H^v` of `p:eq:sigmapath`.  No finite total area, no
  annealed stationarity and no abstract stationary *probability* law is used.
* Time is integrated against an arbitrary σ-finite reflection-invariant measure
  `ν` on an arbitrary additive time group `T`; the manuscript case is
  `T = ℝ` with `ν = volume`, i.e. genuine integration over real time
  (`lintegral_timeMassTransport_real`, `integral_timeMassTransport_real`).
* Both the **nonnegative** clause (`ℝ≥0∞`-valued `W`, no integrability at all,
  Tonelli only) and the **signed** clause (real-valued `W`, with the exact
  integrability hypothesis `Integrable (fun p => W p.1 0 p.2) (Q.prod ν)`) are
  proved; the signed clause comes with the transfer
  `integrable_incoming_of_outgoing`, so the integrability needed on the
  incoming side is *not* an extra assumption but a consequence.
* The manuscript's convention "values at nonvertex source or target times can be
  set to zero" is not a hypothesis here: it is a property of the kernel `W`
  chosen by the consumer, and any such `W` is admissible as long as it is
  measurable and covariant.
* The parabolic scaling hypothesis `V(S_C Ω, C²s, C²t) = C^{-2} V(Ω,s,t)` of
  `p:lem:timeMTP` is **not** used here and is not assumed.  It is needed only
  for the *other* half of the manuscript proof, namely the passage from the
  fixed-environment identity proved here to the **annealed** identity, which
  goes through the spatial transport `T(H,w,z)` of `p:eq:spacefromtime` and the
  spatial mass-transport principle `p:eq:mtp`.  Nothing here claims the annealed
  statement.

Connection to the invariance producer.  The hypothesis
`∀ r, MeasurePreserving (θ r) Q Q` is precisely what
`ReflectedGMS.TwoSided.measurePreserving_twoSidedShiftBy_of_cylinderShift`
produces for the σ-finite weighted two-sided law `twoSidedGridLaw PF w δ`, for an
arbitrary (in particular non-summable, area-type) vertex weight `w`, from the
single finite-cylinder input `TwoSidedCylinderShiftIdentity PF w δ`.  The last
section of this file carries that instantiation out in full
(`lintegral_timeMassTransport_twoSidedGridLaw`,
`integral_timeMassTransport_twoSidedGridLaw`), with the time index the grid
`ℤ` and `ν = Measure.count`; the σ-finiteness of the mixture itself is proved
here (`sfinite_twoSidedGridLaw`) rather than assumed.  The remaining producer
for the actual area clock is unchanged and is the one named in
`SigmaFiniteTwoSidedShift`: the area-weighted finite-cylinder shift identity.

For a real-valued transport kernel the identity needs absolute convergence.  The
integrability hypothesis is imposed on the *outgoing* side only; the incoming
side is then automatically integrable, because the identity of the previous
section applies to `ENNReal.ofReal ‖W ω s t‖`. -/

The invariance premise of the identities above is produced, for the σ-finite
weighted two-sided law of an **arbitrary** vertex weight (in particular a
non-summable area weight), by
`ReflectedGMS.TwoSided.measurePreserving_twoSidedShiftBy_of_cylinderShift`.  Here
that producer is plugged in, so that the temporal transport identity holds for
the two-sided grid law under its single remaining finite-cylinder input.  The
time index is the grid `ℤ` and the time measure is the counting measure. -/

/-! ## Remaining mathematical gap

What is proved here is the fixed-environment (quenched) temporal identity
`p:eq:timeMTP`: outgoing and incoming transports through the time origin agree
for any measurable time-shift covariant kernel, once the trajectory measure is
σ-finite and time-shift invariant, with both the nonnegative and the signed
integrability clauses and with genuine integration over real time.

Two inputs of the manuscript lemma are deliberately *not* claimed:

* the shift invariance itself for the actual area clock, which reduces (by
  `ReflectedGMS.Temporal.SigmaFiniteTwoSidedShift`) to the area-weighted
  finite-cylinder shift identity `TwoSidedCylinderShiftIdentity PF (cellArea F) δ`,
  staffed separately;
* the passage from the fixed environment to the **annealed** law, which is the
  part of the manuscript proof that uses the spatial transport
  `T(H,w,z) = a_{H_z}^{-1} E_H^{H_w} ∫ 1_{X_t = H_z} V(Ω,0,t) dt` of
  `p:eq:spacefromtime`, its parabolic scaling degree `-2`, and the spatial
  mass-transport principle `p:eq:mtp`.  The parabolic scaling hypothesis of
  `p:lem:timeMTP` is used only there, which is why it does not appear above.
