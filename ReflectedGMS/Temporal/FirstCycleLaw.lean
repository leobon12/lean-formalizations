# The first complete cycle of the actual walk and its law (regeneration milestone 2(b)/(c))

`Temporal/TwoSidedCycleSpliceKernel.hcyc_rootedRegKernel` asks, at each live environment, for a
probability law `ν` on the cycle space `Cyc (rootLabel e)` with clause (b)
`CompleteCycleReversal ν` and clause (c) `RootedCycleDecomposition (rootedRegKernel … e) ν`.
The intended `ν` is **the law of the first complete cycle of the actual area walk from the
root**: the holding at the root followed by the excursion, killed at the first complete return.

This module fixes that `ν` once and for all (both (b) and (c) are stated about it):

* `RegLL` — the one-sided regularity subtype (right-regular with left limits);
* `firstCycle v : RegLL → Cyc v` — the path killed at its first complete return to `v`, with
  that return time as length (`isCycle_killedAtReturn`); a fixed two-step default cycle when the
  path does not start at `v` or never returns (`defaultCycle`); **measurable**
  (`measurable_firstCycle`);
* `regSlotLaw G hwalk n e` — the forward label law `slotLaw G n e` lifted to `RegLL` through the
  sample space (`TwoSidedCycleSpliceKernel.exists_slotLaw_lift`); a law on the subtype is unique
  given its image (`regSlotLaw_eq_of_map_val_eq`);
* **`firstCycleLaw G hwalk n e : Measure (Cyc n)`** — `(regSlotLaw G hwalk n e).map (firstCycle n)`,
  a probability measure; at the root it is the `ν` of `hcyc_rootedRegKernel`;
* `firstCycleLaw_eq_map_of_map_val_eq` — any lift of the slot law computes it;
* `firstCycleLaw_eq_map_rootedRegKernel` — it is the law of the first cycle of the forward half
  under the rooted kernel on the regularity subtype (with `hmeas` discharged by
  `RegenerationKernelMeasurability.measurable_slotTransition`, or with any `hmeas`).

Nothing here is probabilistic: no reversal or decomposition statement is proved.
