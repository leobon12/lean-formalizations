# `hcyc` modulo clauses 2 and 3 (regeneration lane, milestone 2 reduced to two named inputs)

`Temporal/TwoSidedCycleSplice` proves `CycleErgodic (entranceLaw ν) rho` for the
entrance-rooted i.i.d.-cycle law of any cycle law `ν` (milestone 2(a)).  This module states the
two remaining clauses of the handoff (`outputs/fable-regenerative-invariance-handoff.md`,
"Milestones 2–3", items (b), (c)) as named hypotheses and proves that they give `hcyc`.

## The cycle reversal

`cycRev` keeps the holding at `v` in front and reverses the excursion (right-continuously):
for a cycle `c` = hold `h` at `v` ⊕ excursion `E` of total length `L`,

  `cycRev c u = v` (`u < h`),  `c((L + h − u)−)` (`h ≤ u < L`),  `∞` (`u ≥ L`).

It is a measurable self-map of the cycle space (`measurable_cycRev`); the holding time is read
off the path along a dense sequence (`holdE_eq`).

## The two hypotheses

* **(b) `CompleteCycleReversal ν`**: `ν.map cycRev = ν` — clause 2, reversal invariance of the
  complete stopped cycle.
* **(c) `RootedCycleDecomposition P ν`**: `P.map rho ≪ mixedLaw ν`, where `mixedLaw ν` is the
  splice of the independent sequence with law `ν` at the indices `k ≥ -1` and `ν.map cycRev` at
  `k ≤ -2` — clause 3 proper (cycle decomposition of the rooted law, the straddling holding
  `Gamma(2)` vs `Exp`), which does NOT presuppose clause 2: re-rooting the vertex-rooted law at
  the first return puts the forward excursion `E₁` (with the straddling holding) at index `-1`
  and, at `k ≤ -2`, the cycles `hold h'_k ⊕ rev E'_{k-1}` of the backward copy, i.e. reversed
  forward cycles.

The handoff's literal clause 3, `EntranceAbsCont P ν : P.map rho ≪ entranceLaw ν`, is (b)+(c)
(`entranceAbsCont_of_reversal`), and it alone gives `CycleErgodic P rho`
(`cycleErgodic_of_entranceAbsCont`).  `hcyc_of_reversal_and_decomposition` is the fibrewise form
consumed by `RegenerativeInvarianceFiberwise.fiberwiseConstant_of_cycleErgodic`.
