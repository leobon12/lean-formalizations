**⚠ VACUOUS/SUPERSEDED (2026-09-18):** the gated (F2′) route of this module,
`FrameSimilarityTransferOn similarityClosedGate κF` at the origin-rooted `κF`, is FALSE (trap #8,
argued, `outputs/final-route-review.2026-09-18.md` §2): a gate environment whose origin lies on the
boundary mask with label `0` inactive has the cemetery fibre
(`FlowCodingKernel.flowFibre_of_not_live`), so the instances of `regenerativeInvariance_cellRooted`
at `κF` and that gate are vacuous; `hregen` itself is true.  Superseded by the
all-starts route `Temporal/CellRootedRegenAllStarts*`
(`CellRootedRegenAllStartsWeld.hregen_validLaw_interior_of_ratShiftBridge`), which still reuses
`const_eq_of_shiftInvariantMixture` and `RatShiftBridge` from this file.  Also stale below: the
positivity input IS proved (`AreaWalkFixedTimePositivityWeld.areaWalkFixedTimePositivity_of_admissible`).

# `hregen` at the cell-rooted law (rooting-decision packet P3)

Repair R2 (light form, `outputs/rooting-decision-handoff.2026-09-18.md`) states `hregen` at the
cell-rooted law `Q := (ν ⊗ₘ κ).map cellRoot`.  This module proves

  `RegenerativeInvariance ((ν ⊗ₘ κ).map cellRoot) reRootFlow reScale Prod.fst`

from two fixed-environment inputs about `κ` that quantify ONLY over `reFrame`-invariant test
functionals (`CellRootedTest`):

* **(F1′)** `FrameFiberwiseConstant ν κ` — for `ν`-a.e. environment, a test functional is
  `κ e`-a.s. constant.  Implied by the brief's `FiberwiseConstant ν κ plainShift reScale`.
* **(F2′)** `FrameSimilarityTransferOn G κ` — the a.s. value is the same at similar environments,
  for `e` in a measurable, conull, similarity-closed gate `G`.

The pull-back principle: `B ↦ B ∘ cellRoot` maps `reRootFlow`/`reScale`-invariant functionals on
the cell-rooted side to `plainShift`/`reScale`/`reFrame`-invariant ones (`cellRoot_reFrame`), the
environment function is the manuscript's `(G ∩ constantSet).indicator condMean`, and
`b (cellRoot ω).1 = b ω.1` because `(cellRoot ω).1` is a translate of `ω.1`.

## Why (F2′) is GATED

Off the kernel's gate the fibre of `κF = flowKernel …` is the cemetery point mass
`δ cemFlow`, and a test functional may read the (constant) cemetery position relative to the
cells of `e` (e.g. "the constant position lies in the left half of its cell", which is
`plainShift`-, `reScale`- and `reFrame`-invariant).  By `reFrame` invariance
`B (translateEnv u e, cemFlow) = B (e, cemetery label path, constant position u)`, so the brief's
ungated transfer (ii) would force such a functional to be independent of `u` at every environment
off the gate — false as soon as the gate misses one environment (argued, not formalized).  The
gated form is strictly weaker and is all the reduction uses; `regenerativeInvariance_cellRooted_ungated`
records the brief's literal shape as the `G = univ` instance.

## The two halves of (F2′)

* `frameSimilarityTransferOn_of_halves`: (F2′) ⇐ dilation half ∧ translation half
  (`IsSimilarity s u` = dilation by `s` about `0`, then translation by `s • u`).
* **Dilation half** ⇐ `KernelDilationCovariantOn G κ` — the law-level identity
  `(κ e).map (scaleCoding C e) = κ (similarityTargetEnv C 0 hC e)`
  (`dilationTransferOn_of_kernelDilationCovariant`).
* **Translation half** = the manuscript's start-cell independence (tex:1503-1506):
  `const_eq_of_shiftInvariantMixture` proves the manuscript argument abstractly (the σ-finite
  area mixture is shift invariant, so `{X_0 = u, B ≠ b(u)}` is null, so is its shift, hence
  `b(v) = b(u)` on `{X_q = u}`), and `translationTransferOn_of_startIndependence` reduces the
  translation half to a family of start-at-vertex laws `P e n` with: frame identification
  (`hframe`, `hcover`), start (`hstart`), rational-shift invariance of the area mixture
  (`hshift`), pointwise (F1) on the gate, and **positivity** (`hpos`).  No producer of the
  positivity input exists in the tree (see `AreaWalkFixedTimePositivity`, the precise raw form).

## (F1) at the bridge kernel

`fiberwiseConstant_flowKernel_of_ratShiftBridge`: (F1) at `κF` from the PROVED cycle ergodicity
of the actual regeneration kernel at every environment
(`CycleHolding.cycleErgodic_rootedRegKernel`), transported along
`FlowCodingKernel.map_ratRead_flowKernel_eq_rootedRegKernel`, given the carrier bridge
`RatShiftBridge` — the a.e. form of "`ratRead ∘ plainShift τ = rho ∘ ratRead`": along the cycle
orbit, the rational code of `rho^[n+1] w` is the rational reading of a real time shift of a
configuration whose rational reading is the code of `rho^[n] w`.  The rational reading does NOT
commute with irrational shifts pointwise, which is why this is an a.e. statement (no jump of the
path at `q + T_n`, `q ∈ ℚ`) and stays a named input here (the pointwise form `RatShiftBridgeOn` is PROVED:
`RatShiftBridgeProof.ratShiftBridgeOn_interiorField`).

Nothing here constructs the start laws, the covariant representative, the carrier bridge, the
positivity producer, `hsys`, or either main theorem.

# `hcyc` discharged at the actual regeneration kernel

`CycleDecompositionWeld.hcyc_rootedRegKernel_of_holdings'` reduced cycle ergodicity of the actual
kernel `rootedRegKernel … (measurable_slotTransition …)` to two facts about the first-cycle law
`ν = firstCycleLaw G hwalk (rootLabel e) e` on the live set:

* (R4) `HoldExcIndep ν` — `CycleHoldingIndependence.holdExcIndep_firstCycleLaw`, PROVED;
* (R5) `StraddleAbsCont ν` — `CycleHoldingStraddle.straddleAbsCont_firstCycleLaw`, PROVED.

Both hold at EVERY live environment of EVERY admissible gate, so:

* **`cycleErgodic_rootedRegKernel`**: `CycleErgodic (rootedRegKernel G hG hwalk
  (measurable_slotTransition G hG hwalk) e) rho` at every `e` (off the live set the fibre is the
  cemetery point mass), for every measurable admissible gate `G` — no named input;
* `hcyc_rootedRegKernel_actual`: the a.e. form consumed by the regeneration lane, for every
  environment law;
* **`hcyc_similarityClosedGate`**: at the law-independent similarity-closed gate, from MTP + (FE):
  the gate is conull and `hcyc` holds;
* `fiberwiseConstant_rootedRegKernel_of_hroot`: (F1) of the regeneration lane at the actual kernel
  from the flow owner's `hroot` ALONE (clauses (b), (c) and `hmeas` are all discharged).

along the cycle orbit of `μ`-a.e. regular two-sided path, the rational code of the next
re-rooting is the rational reading of a real time shift of a configuration whose rational
reading is the current code.  Satisfiability (argued): take the càdlàg completion of `rho^[n] w`
and the first return time; it holds whenever no jump of the path falls on `q + T_k` for rational
`q`, which is a.s. by the strong Markov property at the return times and continuity of the

constant. -/
