# `flowGate` meets the gate conditions of `ScaledRootChainSystemOn`

`Limit/ScaledRootChainSystemGated.ScaledRootChainSystemOn G …` asks of its gate `G ⊆ Ω × Grid`:
measurable, preserved exactly by every marked time shift `θ t` and every positive marked scaling
`S C`, and conull for the marked law `P ⊗ ν`.  On the flow carrier
`FlowSpace = Env × FlowCoding` with the marked flow `gridFlow` and scaling `gridScaleFlow`
(`Temporal/TwoSidedRegenerationFlowGrid`), the natural gate is the environment-coordinate gate
`Temporal/SimilarityClosedGateFlow.flowGate`, marked: `markedFlowGate := Prod.fst ⁻¹' flowGate`.

* `invariantGate_markedFlowGate`: measurable and invariant (from `preimage_reRootFlow_flowGate`,
  `preimage_reScale_flowGate`; every `C`, not only `C > 0`).
* `ae_mem_flowGate_of_marginal`, `ae_mem_markedFlowGate_of_marginal`: conull for EVERY law `Q` on
  `FlowSpace` whose environment marginal is absolutely continuous w.r.t. an MTP+FE law — hence
  independent of the origin- vs cell-rooting decision, provided the chosen rooted law has an
  environment marginal `≪ ν` (the origin-rooted `ν ⊗ₘ κ` has marginal exactly `ν`:
  `ae_mem_markedFlowGate_compProd`).
* `not_exists_scaleFixed_mem_markedFlowGate` (via `eq_one_of_isSimilarity_self_of_mem`): no point
  of the gate is fixed by a nontrivial scaling, so the gated obstruction
  `ScaledRootChainGated.false_of_scaleFixed_mem` cannot fire on this gate (the seventh trap does
  not recur inside `flowGate`).
* `scaledRootChainSystemOn_markedFlowGate`: `ScaledRootChainSystemOn markedFlowGate Q gridMeasure
  gridFlow gridScaleFlow blkFam sel` from the gated block data
  (`FlowSpaceBlockSystem.GatedRootChainBlocks flowGate …`, the output of
  `gatedRootChainBlocks_of_localTimeScaleOn`), the UNMARKED transport
  `ParabolicTemporalTransport Q reRootFlow reScale`, and the marginal condition.  The marked
  transport is averaged in by `parabolicTemporalTransport_prod_of_uniformGridLaw`.

Not provided: a `LocalTimeScaleOn flowGate reRootFlow reScale τ` (the concrete gated time scale;
`FlowSpaceBlockSystem` handoff §4.2) and the unmarked transport at the actual law.

/-! ### 3. The gate contains no scale-fixed point

`ScaledRootChainGated.false_of_scaleFixed_mem`: a scale-fixed point INSIDE the gate refutes the
gated covariance just as a fixed point anywhere refuted the ungated one.  So the gated structure
on `markedFlowGate` is only non-vacuous if no point of the gate is fixed by a nontrivial
scaling.  That is proved here: a gate environment fixed by `z ↦ C z` would have the cells through
the origin (finitely bounded by `maxDiamHittingBall · 1 < ∞`, positive by the nonempty interior)
with supremal diameter `M` satisfying `M ≥ C M` and `M ≥ C⁻¹ M`, so `C = 1`.  (The
self-similar `e*` of the `FlowSpaceBlockSystem` handoff has `maxDiamHittingBall e* 1 = ∞`.) -/
