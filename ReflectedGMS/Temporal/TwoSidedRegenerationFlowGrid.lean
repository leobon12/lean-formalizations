# The regeneration flow on the marked carrier, in the consumer's `hθ` / `hS` shape

The directional bracket-LLN weld (`Limit/DirectionalBracketLLNWeld`,
`Limit/DirectionalBracketLLNGatesCoding`) takes the marked flow and scaling on `(Env × X) × Grid`
through the binders

* `hθ : ∀ t y d, θ t (y, d) = (θΩ t y, translate (timeVec t) d)`,
* `hS : ∀ C y d, S C (y, d) = (SΩ C y, gridScale C d)`.

Here `X = FlowCoding`, `θΩ = reRootFlow`, `SΩ = reScale` (`Temporal/TwoSidedRegenerationFlow`),
and `gridFlow` / `gridScaleFlow` are the marked maps: `hθ` and `hS` hold by `rfl`
(`gridFlow_apply`, `gridScaleFlow_apply`), and the three pointwise flow fields of
`ConditionalTemporalAveraging.TemporalBlockSystem` (`flow_zero`, `flow_add`, `measurable_flow`) and
the field `flowScale` of `ScaledRootChain.ScaledRootChainSystem` hold (`gridFlow_zero`,
`gridFlow_add`, `measurable_gridFlow`, `flowScaleIntertwine_gridFlow`).  The block fields and
the transport are not addressed here.
