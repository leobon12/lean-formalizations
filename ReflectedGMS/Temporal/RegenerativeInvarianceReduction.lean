# `p:lem:regeninvariant` at an annealed law `νenv ⊗ₘ κ`, reduced to two fixed-environment inputs

The annealed two-sided rooted law of the manuscript is "first sample `𝓗` from its spatial law
and then sample the two-sided process from `H_0`" (tex:1352): a composition `νenv ⊗ₘ κ` of the
environment law with the kernel `κ : Kernel Env X` of fixed-environment two-sided laws on the
trajectory coding, with `envOf = Prod.fst`.  The fixed-environment laws are the `pathLaw` data
of `Temporal/ActualConditionalPathIntegral.MarkedPathProcess`; nothing here constructs them.

This module proves the **last paragraph** of the manuscript proof of `p:lem:regeninvariant`
(tex:1509-1512) — "the set of environments for which the conditional law of `B` is a point
mass … is measurable … preserved by similarities … on this invariant set take the common mean,
and set it equal to zero elsewhere" — verbatim, and thereby reduces
`RegenerativeInvariance (νenv ⊗ₘ κ) θΩ SΩ Prod.fst` to two named inputs about the kernel:

* `FiberwiseConstant νenv κ θΩ SΩ` — **(F1)** for `νenv`-almost every environment, every
  bounded measurable jointly invariant functional is `κ e`-almost surely constant on the fiber.
  This is the first two paragraphs of the manuscript proof (iid cycles, Bernoulli shift, the
  `L_v/h_v` size-biasing), i.e. fixed-environment ergodicity; and it is *necessary*
  (`fiberwiseConstant_of_regenerativeInvariance`).
* `SimilarityTransfer κ θΩ SΩ` — **(F2)** the almost-sure value of such a functional under
  the conditional law is the same at similar environments.  This is the manuscript's
  "`v`-independence" (translations by a cell displacement, tex:1503-1506, via the σ-finite
  shift-invariant measure) together with "the conditional area-clock law transforms
  canonically" (dilations, the `law_φ` field of `MarkedPathProcess.similarityCoding`).  It is
  stated for *every* pair of similar environments because the environment-ergodicity
  hypothesis `EnvironmentErgodic` tests **exactly** invariant sets; an almost-everywhere
  version would not feed it.

## What is proved

* `condMean`, `condDev`, `constantSet` — the conditional mean `∫ B(e,x) dκ_e(x)`, the
  conditional `L¹` deviation, and the measurable set of environments on which the deviation
  vanishes (`measurable_condMean`, `measurable_condDev`, `measurableSet_constantSet`, from
  `StronglyMeasurable.integral_kernel_prod_right'`).
* `ae_eq_condMean_of_mem_constantSet` / `mem_constantSet_of_ae_const` — the deviation vanishes
  exactly when the functional is a.s. constant on the fiber, and then its constant is the
  conditional mean.
* `regenerativeInvariance_compProd_of_fiberwise` — **the reduction**: (F1) and (F2) give
  `RegenerativeInvariance (νenv ⊗ₘ κ) θΩ SΩ Prod.fst`, with the environment function
  `(constantSet κ B).indicator (condMean κ B)`, measurable and *exactly* similarity-invariant.
* `jointErgodic_compProd_of_fiberwise` — composed with
  `RegenerativeInvarianceErgodic.regenerativeInvariance_iff_jointErgodic`: the annealed joint
  ergodic theorem from (F1), (F2) and environment ergodicity.
* `fiberwiseConstant_of_regenerativeInvariance` — (F1) is necessary.
* `fiberwiseConstant_const_dirac`, `similarityTransfer_const_dirac` — anti-vacuity: the two
  inputs are jointly satisfiable (a point-mass kernel with a trajectory flow that forgets the
  environment coordinate).

## Satisfiability at the actual law

Both inputs are the manuscript's own claims, stated for the kernel `κ e = ℙ_e^{H_0}` on the
càdlàg coding.  (F1) is `p:lem:regeninvariant`, first sentence, per environment; the
manuscript proves it for every connected recurrent environment, and only `νenv`-a.e. is asked.
(F2) needs the rooted flow of `RegenerativeInvarianceErgodic` (the flow must translate the
environment by the current cell's displacement and relabel canonically): on that flow a
functional invariant under `θΩ` is determined by the orbit, and since a translate `e + u` has
the *same* re-rooted environments `e - c(w)` (canonical labels are unique), translation transfer
follows from flow invariance plus translation covariance of `κ`; dilation transfer is the
`law_φ` covariance.  Neither is proved here.

## What is *not* proved

(F1) and (F2) at the actual kernel; the kernel itself; `p:lem:regeninvariant`,
`p:prop:timeergodic`, `p:lem:bracketlimit`, `p:thm:areaclt`, either main theorem.
