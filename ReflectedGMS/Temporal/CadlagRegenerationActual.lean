# The actual reflected walk is cycle-ergodic on the regenerative coding

This module attaches the checked one-step whole-cycle regeneration of the **actual** reflected
walk (`Temporal/ActualExcursionErgodicIdentification.map_futureAt_firstReturnTime`,
`indepFun_killedPathAt_futureAt`, both on the sample space `PF.Ω` with the future read into the
raw `Trajectory V`) to the regenerative coding `RegenPath v` of
`Temporal/CadlagRegenerationCoding`, where the cycle shift is a measurable self-map, and closes
the forward half of the first paragraph of `p:lem:regeninvariant`'s proof.

## Results

* `ae_isRegenPath` — **the actual trajectory lies in the coding almost surely**: under
  `PF.P v`, the path is right-regular ((ii)+(R)), starts at `v`, is at `v` at arbitrarily large
  times (property (v)), is off `v` at arbitrarily large times (`ae_leaves`: property (iv) at the
  integer times plus the a.s. finiteness of the exponential exit time), and has dense vertex
  times (property (i) along a dense sequence).
* `exists_regenLaw` — the law of the actual walk from `v` **lifts** to a probability law `μ` on the
  coding (`μ.map Subtype.val = PF.law v`) under which `μ.map (regenShift v) = μ` and
  `IndepFun (regenCycle v) (regenShift v) μ`: the two actual-process regeneration facts,
  transported to the coding.  The lift is unique (`eq_of_map_val_eq`).
* `cycleErgodic_actualWalk` — **the law of the actual reflected walk from `v`, on the regenerative
  coding, is ergodic under the cycle shift**: every bounded measurable functional of the coded
  path that is invariant under re-rooting at the first return to `v` is `μ`-a.s. constant.
  Hypotheses: `IsReflectedWalk` and connectivity of the graph only.

## What this is, and what it is not

This is the forward half of clause 1 of the handoff's four clauses (two-sided i.i.d. cycle law):
forward cycles are i.i.d. (`iIndep_cycleSigma`) and the forward cycle shift is ergodic.  It is a
statement about the **forward, fixed-start, fixed-environment** law.  The two-sided law
`ℙ_H^v`, the reversal of the complete stopped cycle (clause 2), the `L_v/h_v` size-biasing
(clause 3) and the start-vertex independence (clause 4) are not addressed here, and nothing here
certifies `p:lem:regeninvariant`, `p:prop:timeergodic`, `p:lem:bracketlimit`, `p:thm:areaclt` or
either main theorem.

The coding is the **right-regular, forward** coding, not `TrajectoryCoding.CadlagPath`: see the
module docstring of `Temporal/CadlagRegenerationCoding` (forward regeneration needs right
regularity only; the two-sided coding will need the a.s. left limits of
`Forms/VertexIndicatorLeftLimits`).

/-- **The actual walk leaves `v` at arbitrarily large times.**  At each integer time `n`,
property (iv) makes the future after `n` on `{X_n = v}` a fresh copy of the walk from `v`, whose
exit time from `v` is a.s. finite (property (iii)); by right regularity the exit is seen along a
dense sequence of times. -/
