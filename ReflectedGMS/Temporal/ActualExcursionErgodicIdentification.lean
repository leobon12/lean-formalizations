/-! # Actual whole-cycle regeneration at a vertex

The manuscript lemma *Regenerative invariant functionals* (`p:lem:regeninvariant`)
begins:

> Consider the law obtained by concatenating a doubly infinite sequence of
> independent complete return cycles from `v`, with time zero at the entrance to
> the zeroth cycle.  Cycles include their initial holding at `v` and the
> subsequent excursion back to `v`.

Attaching the checked iid-cycle ergodicity of
`ReflectedGMS.Temporal.BernoulliCycleInvariant` to the *actual* reflected process
therefore needs the regeneration property for **complete return cycles**: the
whole path segment from `v` until the first return to `v`, at the actual random
return time, not on a deterministic grid.

`ReflectedGMS.Temporal.RegenerativeErgodicIdentification` proves the manuscript's
excursion-reversal cylinder identity on the constant-step grid `0, δ, …, nδ`.
That does **not** determine a whole cycle: a grid loop may return to the root
between two grid times, so a grid cylinder does not see where the cycle ends.
This file supplies the missing whole-cycle statement.

## What is proved

Write `τ v = targetReturnTime X {v} 1` for the **first complete return time to
`v`**: the first time the path is back at `v` after it has left `v`
(`targetReturnTime X A (n+1) = hitAfter X A (exitAfter X (targetReturnTime X A n))`
with `A = {v}` and `τ⁰ = 0`).  The *cycle* is the path killed at that time,
`killedPathAt X (τ v)`, i.e. `s ↦ X s` for `s < τ v` and `∞` afterwards: exactly
the initial holding at `v` followed by the excursion back to `v`.

* `aemeasurableSetStopped_killedPathAt`: the killed path is measurable for the
  stopped σ-algebra `ℱ_τ` of any a.e. stopping time `τ`.  This is the
  progressive-measurability step that the cylinder machinery of
  `ReflectedGMS.Forms` never needed and that whole-cycle regeneration does.

* `measure_killedPathAt_inter_futureAt` — **whole-cycle regeneration, set form**:
  under the actual fixed-start law `PF.P v`,
  `P_v[cycle ∈ A, post-cycle path ∈ B] = P_v[cycle ∈ A] · P_v[path ∈ B]`,
  for arbitrary measurable sets of trajectories.

* `map_futureAt_firstReturnTime`: the path after the first complete return to `v`
  has again the law `PF.law v`.  (The process genuinely restarts at the end of a
  cycle; this is the "regeneration" half.)

* `map_killedPathAt_prod_futureAt` and `indepFun_killedPathAt_futureAt`: the
  joint-law and `IndepFun` forms — the first complete return cycle at `v` is
  independent of the post-cycle trajectory, and the post-cycle trajectory is a
  fresh copy of the process started at `v`.

## Route and reuse

No new probabilistic input is produced.  The proof reuses

* `ReflectedWalk.Theorem16.strongMarkov_completed`, the strong Markov property of
  `IsReflectedWalk` at an a.e. stopping time, and
* `ReflectedGMS.TargetReturnRecursion.ae_forall_targetReturnTime_finite_mem`,
  `isAEStoppingTime_targetReturnTime`, `aemeasurable_targetReturnTime`, which give
  the actual reflected process's own a.s. finiteness of the return times to a
  finite target.

In particular **no** ordinary embedded-chain recurrence is assumed and no CTRW
killed at an accumulation time is used: the a.s. completion of the cycle is the
already-proved property of the actual reflected walk, specialised to the
singleton target `{v}`.

## What is *not* proved here

This is the one-step regeneration.  Iterating it over the successive return times
`τ v ^[n]` to obtain the full iid cycle sequence, and then length-biasing the
initial holding to pass from the entrance-rooted cycle law to `PP_H^v`, remain
open; see the handoff note for the exact next producer.
