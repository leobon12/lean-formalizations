# `GridAveragedConstant` from regeneration and environment ergodicity

`ReflectedGMS/Temporal/TailAverageIdentification.lean` reduced the identification of the tail
limit of `p:lem:timeconverge` with `𝔼[F]` to the single named input
`TailAverageIdentification.GridAveragedConstant`: for every bounded Borel `ψ`, the grid average
`B(ω) = ∫ ψ(L(ω, d)) dν(d)` is almost surely constant.  The manuscript obtains it in one
sentence (tex:1527):

> The invariant version of `L` and translation/dilation invariance of the grid law show that
> `B` is invariant under time re-rooting and parabolic scaling.  Lemma `p:lem:regeninvariant`
> makes it a similarity-invariant function of `H`.  Environment ergodicity makes it the
> constant `𝔼[ψ(L)]`.

This module proves that sentence, isolating `p:lem:regeninvariant` as a named input.

## What is proved

* `ae_eq_const_of_similarityInvariantFun` — **environment ergodicity**: under
  `EnvironmentLaws.EnvironmentErgodic ν` (the main theorem's hypothesis
  `AmbientEnvironmentErgodic`, unfolded), a measurable function of the environment that is
  unchanged by every physical similarity is `ν`-almost surely constant.  The proof tests the
  zero-one law on the countably many level sets that separate points of `ℝ`
  (`exists_eventuallyEq_const_of_forall_separating`).
* `integral_comp_flow_eq_of_measurePreserving` — **the grid average of an invariant version
  is invariant**: if `L⋆(θ ω, τ d) = L⋆(ω, d)` and `τ` preserves the grid law, then
  `∫ ψ(L⋆(θ ω, d)) dν(d) = ∫ ψ(L⋆(ω, d)) dν(d)`.  Used once for time re-rooting and once for
  parabolic scaling.
* `gridAveragedConstant_of_regenerativeInvariance` — `GridAveragedConstant P ν L` from
  - an invariant version `L⋆ =ᵐ L`, invariant under the joint time flow and the joint
    parabolic scaling of trajectory and grid (the last clause of `p:lem:timeconverge`),
  - invariance of the grid law under the grid's time translations and dilations,
  - the named input `RegenerativeInvariance` (`p:lem:regeninvariant`),
  - environment ergodicity and absolute continuity of the environment marginal.
* `gridAveragedConstant_condExp_of_regenerativeInvariance` — the same for the tail conditional
  expectation itself, i.e. exactly the `hgrid` input of
  `GridChainTailConstant.ae_ae_chain_of_gridAveragedConstant`.
* `regenerativeInvariance_dirac` — the named input is not self-contradictory.

## What is *not* proved here

`RegenerativeInvariance` itself — `p:lem:regeninvariant` in annealed form.  Its manuscript
proof needs, for the actual process: the two-sided concatenated iid return-cycle law at a
vertex, the reversal invariance of the complete stopped return cycle, the length-biased
entrance/age decomposition identifying the concatenated law with `ℙ_H^v`, the `v`-independence
step via the σ-finite shift-invariant measure, and the measurable similarity-invariant version.
The checked inputs toward it are `Temporal/ActualExcursionErgodicIdentification` (one-step
whole-cycle regeneration), `Temporal/BernoulliCycleInvariant` (ergodicity of the iid cycle
shift) and `Temporal/HoldingBiasLaw`.  Nor is the invariant version `L⋆` constructed here.
Nothing here certifies `p:lem:regeninvariant`, `p:prop:timeergodic`, `p:lem:bracketlimit`,
`p:thm:areaclt` or either main theorem.

/-! ### The named input `p:lem:regeninvariant` -/

/-- **`p:lem:regeninvariant` in annealed form.**

`θΩ t` is time re-rooting of the (annealed, two-sided, rooted) trajectory, `SΩ C` its common
parabolic scaling by the factor `C`, and `envOf ω` the environment carried by `ω`.  The input
says: every bounded measurable functional of the trajectory that is invariant under every time
re-rooting **and** every parabolic scaling agrees almost surely with a measurable
similarity-invariant function of the environment.

This is the manuscript's lemma (tex:1490-1512) read through the conditional law given the
environment: `B` is `ℙ_H^v`-almost surely a constant `b(H,v)`, independent of `v`, measurable
in `H`, and similarity-invariant because `B` is scaling covariant.  Scaling invariance of `B`
cannot be dropped: a re-rooting-invariant functional may read off a global length scale of the
environment, which is not similarity-invariant.

Nothing in this definition is asserted. -/

/-! ### Grid averages of an invariant version -/

/-- **The grid average of a jointly invariant function is invariant.**  If, for almost every
grid, `L⋆` does not change when the trajectory is moved by `θ` and the grid by the
law-preserving map `τ`, then its grid-averaged bounded test does not change when only the
trajectory is moved.  Only almost-every-grid invariance is needed, which is what a root-chain
limit delivers (the root chain exhausts the time axis only for almost every grid). -/

/-! ### The reduction -/

/-- **`GridAveragedConstant` from `p:lem:regeninvariant` and environment ergodicity**
(tex:1527).

Inputs, in the manuscript's order:

* `Lstar`, `hL`, `hflow`, `hscale` — the invariant version of the tail limit: almost surely
  equal to `L`, and, for every trajectory and almost every grid, invariant under the joint time
  flow `(θΩ t, τ t)` and the joint parabolic scaling `(SΩ C, Sg C)` of trajectory and grid
  (`p:lem:timeconverge`, last clause);
* `hτ`, `hSg` — the grid law is invariant under the grid's time translations and dilations;
* `hregen` — `p:lem:regeninvariant`;
* `herg`, `henv`, `hmarg` — environment ergodicity, for an environment marginal absolutely
  continuous with respect to the ergodic law.
