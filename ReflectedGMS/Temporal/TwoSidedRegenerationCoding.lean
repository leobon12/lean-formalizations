# The two-sided coding and the fixed-environment two-sided laws (`p:lem:regeninvariant`, data)

The consumer of the regeneration lemma
(`Limit/BracketLLNDisintegratedWeld.ae_forall_bracket_limit_of_regenerativeInvariance_disintegrated`,
through `Temporal/RegenerativeInvarianceReduction.regenerativeInvariance_compProd_of_fiberwise`)
works on the annealed law `νenv ⊗ₘ κ` with `κ : Kernel Code.Env X` the fixed-environment
**two-sided** rooted laws `ℙ_H^{H_0}` of the manuscript (tex:1345), carried on ONE
environment-independent coding.  This module supplies the coding and the laws, environment by
environment; the kernel (measurable dependence on the environment) is
`Temporal/RegenerationKernel`.

## The coding

The manuscript's coding labels cells by their code slots and collapses every nonvertex state to
`∞` (tex:1345).  In this tree a trajectory with values in the vertices of the environment `e` is
`Trajectory (Vertex e.val)`; its label coding `labelTraj` sends `some v` to `some v.val` and
keeps `none`, so it lands in `Trajectory ℕ = ℝ≥0 → Option ℕ`, which does not depend on `e`.

`ℙ_H^v` has independent forward and time-reversed backward halves, each a copy of the process
from `v` (tex:1345).  The two-sided coding is therefore the pair
`TwoSidedCoding := Trajectory ℕ × Trajectory ℕ` — the forward half and the backward half read in
reversed time — with the product law of two copies of the forward label law
(`twoSidedSlotLaw`), exactly as `Temporal/TwoSidedStationaryLaw.twoSidedStartLaw` does on the
sample space.  Regularity subtypes of this coding (right-regularity for the random-time shifts,
left limits for the reversed half) are lifted later, by `RegenerationKernel.liftSubtype`.

## The laws

* `exhaustion e` — the standing exhaustion of the cell graph of `e`: one for which the area clock
  reaches every level-`0` index in finite time whenever such an exhaustion exists
  (`EnvironmentWalkDataProducer.EnvironmentAreaClockAdmissible`, the project's residual clock
  clause), an arbitrary one otherwise.  So `areaClockReaches_exhaustion` turns the project's
  `∃ D` clause into a statement at the canonical exhaustion at no cost.
* `areaFamily e` — the actual area-clock process family of `e` on that exhaustion
  (`Existence.processFamily`, rates `AreaClocks.areaRate`); its sample laws are the consumer's
  quenched laws `AreaClocks.areaSampleLaw (decode e) (exhaustion e) _ v` and its process is
  `AreaClocks.exponentialAreaPath` (`areaFamily_P`, `areaFamily_X`).  It is a reflected walk at
  every admissible environment (`isReflectedWalk_areaFamily`).
* `slotLaw G n e` — the forward label law of the walk from slot `n`, gated by an admissible set
  `G` of environments: the point mass at the cemetery path off `G` and at absent slots.  The gate
  is a parameter because the area family is a reflected walk only at admissible environments
  (a.e. under the annealed hypotheses, not everywhere), and the finite-dimensional recursion of
  `RegenerationKernel` needs the Markov property at every environment it is applied to.
* `twoSidedSlotLaw G n e` — the two-sided law from slot `n`; `rootedLaw G e` — at the root cell
  `rootLabel e` (the cell whose interior contains the origin, `RootDensities.rootAt`).

All are probability measures.  Nothing here is probabilistic beyond the product construction;
nothing here certifies `p:lem:regeninvariant`, `p:prop:timeergodic`, `p:lem:bracketlimit`,
`p:thm:areaclt` or either main theorem.
