# Divergence of the embedded holding times of an arbitrary reflected walk (Gwynne–Sung, p. 26)

Step 2 of the uniqueness proof of Theorem 1.6 (arXiv:2506.18827, Section 3.4) needs the clock of
the embedded chain (3.31) to run to `∞`: the covering lemma
`Theorem16.TimeChange.exists_mem_Ico` — "every `t ≥ 0` lies in `[tⁿ_j, tⁿ_{j+1})`" — rests on
the paper's sentence "a.s. `lim_k ∑_{j ≤ k} Tⁿ_j = ∞`".  This file proves that sentence for an
**arbitrary** process `𝓧` satisfying the properties (i)–(vi) of Theorem 1.6
(`IsReflectedWalk`), at **every** level `n` of an exhaustion:

  `∀ n, ∀ᵐ ω ∂𝓧.P z, ∑' j, TimeChange.stepHolding 𝓧.X (E.Gsub n) j ω = ⊤`

(`Theorem16.ae_tsum_stepHolding_eq_top`; `TimeChange.stepHolding` is *definitionally*
`UniquenessGeneralSide.holdingTime`, so this is literally `∑_j Tⁿ_j = ∞`), together with the
equivalent statement about the times themselves, `tⁿ_j → ∞`
(`Theorem16.ae_tendsto_stepAt_atTop`).

## The argument

The distributional input is the headline of Step 1,
`Theorem16.map_embeddedPairOf_exhaustion`:

  `(𝓧.P z).map (embeddedPairOf 𝓧.X (E.Gsub n) v₀) = E.chainLaw hG n z ⊗ₘ holdingKernel w`,

i.e. the embedded chain `Yⁿ = (X̃_{tⁿ_j})_j` is the Markov chain of (3.2)–(3.3) started at `z`
and, *conditionally on it*, the holding times are independent with
`Tⁿ_j ~ Exponential(w(Yⁿ_j))` (`holdingKernel_apply`).  Since the property
`∑_j ofReal (T_j) = ∞` is a measurable property of the second coordinate of the pair,
`Measure.ae_compProd_of_ae_ae` reduces the claim to: for `E.chainLaw hG n z`-a.e. embedded path
`y`, the product measure `⨂_j Exponential(w(y_j))` gives full mass to the divergent sequences.

The obstacle is that the rates `w(y_j)` are path dependent and need not be bounded, so
`P(T_j > 1) = e^{-w(y_j)}` is not bounded below along the whole sequence.  This is resolved
exactly as in `RateFunction.lean` for the constructed side, by **property (v)** in the form of
Remark 3.1: the chain `Yⁿ` is recurrent, so almost surely it visits a fixed vertex
`z' ∈ VGₙ` at arbitrarily large times (`ConductanceGraph.Exhaustion.chainLaw_ae_exists_gt_eq`).
Along the infinite set `K = {k : y_k = z'}` the rate is the *constant* `w(z')`, the events
`{T_k > 1}`, `k ∈ K`, are independent with the constant probability `e^{-w(z')} > 0`, so
`∑_k P(T_k > 1) = ∞` and the second Borel–Cantelli lemma
(`ProbabilityTheory.measure_limsup_eq_one`, unconditional, no filtration needed) gives that
infinitely many of them occur; the sub-sum over those indices is then already `∞`.  This is
`infinitePi_expMeasure_ae_tsum_eq_top`, the exact analogue of
`RateFunction.expFamily_ae_tsum_div_eq_top` for the *kernel* side, where the i.i.d. rescaling by
a fixed `Exponential(1)` family is replaced by an infinite product of exponentials with varying
rates.

Finally the a.s. statement on the law of the pair is pulled back to `𝓧.P z`
(`MeasureTheory.ae_of_ae_map`, using the a.e.-measurability
`Theorem16.aemeasurable_embeddedPairOf` of the pair), and the real-valued holding sequence
`holdingSeqOf = fun j => (holdingTime …).toReal` is converted back to the `[0,∞]`-valued
`holdingTime` using `Theorem16.holdingTime_ne_top` on the almost sure event
`Theorem16.ae_forall_definedAt` that every `tⁿ_j` is finite.

## Conventions

`hR` (property (ii) at `∞`, `Theorem16.RightContinuousAtInfty`) is carried as an explicit
hypothesis, as in `Theorem16.ae_forall_definedAt` and
`Theorem16.map_embeddedPairOf_exhaustion`, rather than projected out of `IsReflectedWalk`; the
only projection used is `(h z).2.2.1`, property (ii) proper.

/-! ### Divergence of a sum of independent exponentials with infinitely many equal rates

This is the probabilistic core of Lemma 3.5, Step 0 (p. 21, "`∑_j T_{[(n,j)]}` stochastically
dominates a countable sum of `exponential(w(x))` random variables, hence is a.s. infinite"), in
the form needed on the *uniqueness* side: the holding times are not given as a rescaled i.i.d.
family but only through their conditional law, an infinite product of exponentials whose rates
vary along the path. -/

/-- **Divergence of a countable sum of independent exponentials.**  If the rates `r` are positive
and take the *same* value `c > 0` along an infinite set `K ⊆ ℕ` of indices, then almost surely
`∑_j T_j = ∞` for `T` distributed as `⨂_j Exponential(r j)`.

Proof: the events `{T_k > 1}`, `k ∈ K`, are independent
(`iIndepFun_eval_infinitePi`) with the constant probability `e^{-c} > 0`
(`expMeasure_Ioi_one_ne_zero`), so their probabilities sum to `∞` and the second Borel–Cantelli
lemma (`ProbabilityTheory.measure_limsup_eq_one`) says that almost surely infinitely many of
them occur; the sub-sum of the series over those indices is then at least `∑ 1 = ∞`. -/
