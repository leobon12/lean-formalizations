# The capstone: Theorem 1.6 of Gwynne–Sung (arXiv:2506.18827, p. 5)

`Theorem16Statement.lean` states Theorem 1.6 as an unproved `Prop`; `Existence.lean` and
`UniquenessLimit.lean` prove its two halves.  This file **assembles them** into

  `theorem16 … : Theorem16Statement G hmin`

and closes two infrastructure gaps that the files below it flagged.

## 1.  The capstone `theorem16`

The existential clause is `existence_half'` (`MarkovProperty.lean`: `Existence.existence_half`
with property (iv) discharged by `markovProperty_hiv`), and the uniqueness conjunct is
`Theorem16.uniqueness_half`; the only work the capstone itself does is to package Step 2 of
the uniqueness proof (`Theorem16.approximatedBy_of_approximated`).

**One hypothesis remains**, `hstep1`, an explicitly named statement of a result that is being
proved elsewhere; it is not a `sorry`, an `axiom` or a placeholder, and it is discharged by a
one-line substitution of the result named:

* `hstep1` — **Step 1 of the uniqueness proof** (p. 26), in exactly the two pieces Step 1
  produces: the time-changed processes `X̃ⁿ` of (3.32), approximating `X̃` at fixed times
  (`Theorem16.ApproximatedAtFixedTimes`, the conclusion of Step 2 for them; see
  `approximatedBy_of_approximated` for why the literal (3.33) is not used), and the identity
  in law `X̃ⁿ =ᵈ Xⁿ` at one time, i.e. that their one-time marginals are a family `q` not
  depending on the process.  For the paper `q` is the transition function of the
  continuous-time chain (3.15), which is `ContinuousTimeChain.chainFamily_transition_eq`
  below.  It is discharged by `UniquenessGeneralSide.lean` (whose `chainLaw_embedded` is the
  identification of the embedded chain that yields `q`); the theorems there carry right
  continuity at `∞` of the process as a standing hypothesis `hR`, which `IsReflectedWalk` now
  supplies itself (`(h𝓨 x).2.2.2.1`).

### The former hypothesis `hR`, and the approved repair of the statement

Earlier versions of this capstone carried a second hypothesis `hR`: right continuity at `∞`
(`Theorem16.RightContinuousAtInfty`) for an *arbitrary* family satisfying the printed
properties (i)–(vi) — the right-hand form of the paper's Lemma 3.11.  `Lemma311.not_hR`
proves that this hypothesis is **false**: for every countably infinite connected `G` there is a
family satisfying the printed (i)–(vi) verbatim (a single-time kill of the constructed walk, at
the atomless start of its first return sojourn) which is not right continuous at `∞`.  So the
capstone as then routed was vacuous, and the paper's Lemma 3.11 — whose proof presupposes its
conclusion, by taking `τ_k(x)` to be the *smallest* `s` with `X_s = x` — does not hold for the
class cut out by the printed clauses.

The repair, approved by the user and recorded in `Theorem16Statement.lean` and
`STATEMENT_SPEC.md`, completes property (ii): the printed (ii) constrains the path only at
times where `X_t ∈ VG`, and right continuity into the state space `VG ∪ {∞}` (the one-point
compactification, `VG` discrete) additionally requires that at a time with `X_t = ∞` every
vertex is avoided on some `(t, t + ε)` — which is exactly `RightContinuousAtInfty`.  It is now
a conjunct of `IsReflectedWalk`, immediately after `RightContinuous`.  The constructed process
has it (`Existence.rightContinuousAtInfty`, from `RightContinuityAtInfty.lean`, which bypasses
the strong Markov property), so `existence_half'` remains unconditional, and every place that
took `hR` now reads it off `IsReflectedWalk`.  `Lemma311.not_hR` survives, restated for the
class `IsReflectedWalkWeak` cut out by the printed clauses alone, as the justification of the
repair: that class is strictly larger than `IsReflectedWalk`
(`Lemma311.not_forall_isReflectedWalkWeak_isReflectedWalk`).

`SojournRegularity.lean` records that inside Step 2 only a weaker pathwise consequence of
(ii) + `RightContinuousAtInfty` is used (`PathAlmostEverywhereDefined`), and that the weakening
does not extend to Step 1; with the clause part of the statement this no longer affects the
hypothesis list.

The packaging lemma that read `hR` and routed Step 2 through the literal (3.33)
(`approximatedBy_of_shiftBound`) went with the hypothesis: `ShiftBound` is **false** as printed
(`approximatedBy_of_approximated` says why), so nothing may route through it, and
`approximatedBy_of_approximated` — which takes the *conclusion* of Step 2 directly — is the
only packaging of Step 2 this file offers.

## 2.  Gap-fill: the level-`n` holding times diverge (`∑_j Tⁿ_j = ∞` a.s.)

`ContinuousTimeChain.exists_inLevelInterval` and `ContinuousTimeChain.Xn_ne_none` carry the
hypothesis `∑' j, holding Gs Y w E (addr Gs Y n j) = ⊤`, and `RateFunction.lean` proves it
almost surely only for the level `0` (`jointLaw_ae_tsum_holding_addr_zero_eq_top`).
`ConductanceGraph.Exhaustion.jointLaw_ae_tsum_holding_addr_eq_top` proves it for **every**
level: the level-`(n₀+i)` chain also returns to `z` infinitely often
(`chainLaw_ae_exists_gt_eq`), and the unit holding times of the classes `[(n,j)]`, `j ∈ ℕ`,
are an i.i.d. `Exponential(1)` sequence for every `n`, not only for `n = 0`
(`expFamily_map_comp_addr`), so the divergence of a countable sum of exponentials
(`expFamily_ae_tsum_div_eq_top`) applies at every level once it is transported along the
reindexing (`expFamily_ae_tsum_div_addr_eq_top`).  The consequence `Xⁿ_t ≠ ∞` is then
unconditional, and with a single null set for every level and every time, because the
divergence does not mention the time and the levels are countably many:
`ContinuousTimeChain.jointLaw_ae_forall_Xn_ne_none` and, under the paper's `P_z`,
`ContinuousTimeChain.sampleLaw_ae_forall_chainX_ne_none` (fixed-level, fixed-time corollaries
`jointLaw_ae_Xn_ne_none`, `sampleLaw_ae_chainX_ne_none`); the other consumer of the divergence
hypothesis becomes unconditional in the same way
(`ContinuousTimeChain.jointLaw_ae_forall_exists_inLevelInterval`).

## 3.  Gap-fill: the transition-function bridge

`ContinuousTimeChain.lean` dropped its `ReflectedWalk.TransitionUniqueness` import, so its
`chainFamily_transition` is stated as a raw measure equality rather than through
`ProcessFamily.transition`.  `ContinuousTimeChain.chainFamily_transition_eq` is the bridge,
which is what `Theorem16.identDistrib_of_transition` and the `q` of `hstep1` consume.

/-! ## 1.  Divergence of the level-`n` holding times (Lemma 3.5, Step 0, at every level)

`RateFunction.lean` proves "`∑_j T_{[(0,j)]} = ∞` almost surely" by dominating the level-`0`
holding times by a countable sum of i.i.d. `Exponential(w(z))` variables along the infinitely
many times at which the level-`0` chain is at `z`.  The same argument works at every level:
the only level-specific ingredients are the recurrence of the level-`n` chain and the fact
that the unit holding times indexed by the level-`n` classes are i.i.d. `Exponential(1)`.
Both are available for every level, so the hypothesis of
`ContinuousTimeChain.exists_inLevelInterval` can be discharged a.s. at every level. -/

sequence gives the same law `expSeq` on `ℕ → ℝ`; so the divergence transports from level `0`

/-- **Theorem 1.6** (Gwynne–Sung, arXiv:2506.18827, p. 5), assembled.

For a countably infinite connected conductance graph `G` there is a rate function
`w* : VG → (0,∞)` such that for every `w : VG → (0,∞)` with `w ≥ w*` and every starting point
`z`, there is a process `X` with `X₀ = z` satisfying properties (i)–(vi) — with (ii) in its
complete form, i.e. including right continuity at `∞`, the approved modification of the printed
statement recorded in `Theorem16Statement.lean` — and it is unique in law among such processes.
The statement is `Theorem16Statement G hmin`, which is `Theorem16Statement.lean`'s target
verbatim; `hmin` is the Proposition 1.3 energy minimiser of property (vi), instantiated by
`⟨G.energyMin hG, G.energyMin_eqOn hG, G.energyMin_hasFiniteEnergy hG,
  G.energyMin_le_energy hG⟩`.

The existential clause is `existence_half'` (unconditional; `MarkovProperty.lean`) and the
uniqueness conjunct is `Theorem16.uniqueness_half`; the proof below is their assembly together
with the packaging of Step 2 (`Theorem16.approximatedBy_of_approximated`).

The single hypothesis, and the result that discharges it (see the module docstring):

* `hstep1` — Step 1 of the uniqueness proof (p. 26): the time changes `X̃ⁿ` of (3.32),
  approximating the process at fixed times, with the one-time marginals `q` of the
  continuous-time chain (3.15) (`UniquenessGeneralSide.lean`; `q` is
  `ContinuousTimeChain.chainFamily_transition_eq`).  Right continuity at `∞` of the process,
  which every theorem of `UniquenessGeneralSide.lean` carries as `hR`, is available from
  `IsReflectedWalk` itself, so `hstep1` takes nothing beyond `IsReflectedWalk`.

The hypothesis is an honestly named statement, not a placeholder: substituting the result
closes Theorem 1.6 with no further work. -/
