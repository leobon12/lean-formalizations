# Conductance graphs (Gwynne–Sung, Section 1.1)

The standing setup of arXiv:2506.18827: a countably infinite connected graph
`G = (VG, EG, c)` with conductances `c : EG → (0,∞)` and stationary measure

  `π(x) = ∑_{y ∼ x} c(x,y) < ∞`,   (1.1)–(1.2)

where `G` is **not** assumed locally finite.

## Representation

Conductances are carried as a symmetric function `c : V → V → ℝ` that vanishes on
the diagonal, is nonnegative, and is summable in the second variable.  Adjacency is
*derived*: `x ∼ y ↔ 0 < c x y`.  This packages `EG` and `c` in one object and makes
`π` a `tsum` over all of `V`, which is the form every later estimate uses.

Summability of `c x` is exactly the paper's (1.2): the paper writes `π(x) < ∞` for a
sum of nonnegative terms, and for nonnegative families summability and finiteness of
the sum agree.  Vertices of infinite degree are allowed.
