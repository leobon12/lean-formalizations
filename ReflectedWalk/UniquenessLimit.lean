# Step 2 of the uniqueness argument, and the uniqueness half of Theorem 1.6

## What this file contains

1. **Joint measurability** (`measurable_uncurry_dyadicLimit`, `exists_jointlyMeasurable_version`).
   Properties (i)–(vi) do not make `(s, ω) ↦ X̃_s ω` measurable for the product σ-algebra —
   only each `X̃_s` separately.  Without joint measurability the inner integral of (3.34) is
   not a random variable and Fubini is unavailable, so the sentence "by Property (i), `X̃_s ∈ VG`
   for Lebesgue-a.e. `s`" (an exchange of "for each `s`, a.s." into "a.s., for a.e. `s`") has no
   content.  We supply the missing version by the same device `StrongMarkov.lean` uses for the
   future at a stopping time: `X̃_s = lim_k X̃_{2⁻ᵏ⌈2ᵏ s⌉}` by right continuity ((ii) together
   with `RightContinuousAtInfty`), the dyadic ceiling has countable range, and a countable
   limit of jointly measurable maps is jointly measurable.

2. **The sojourn outside `G_n`** (`sojourn`, `ae_sojournNone_eq_zero`, `ae_tendsto_sojourn`):
   the right-hand side of (3.34), and the dominated-convergence statement that it tends to `0`.
   This is the Fubini step: `∫ P(X̃_s = ∞) ds = 0` by property (i), so a.s. `X̃_s ∈ VG` for
   Lebesgue-a.e. `s`, and `1(X̃_s ∉ G_n) ↓ 1(X̃_s = ∞)` as `n → ∞` because the `G_n` exhaust.

3. **Step 2 itself** (`ShiftBound`, `ApproximatedAtFixedTimes`,
   `approximatedAtFixedTimes_of_shiftBound`): for each fixed `t`, a.s. `X̃ⁿ_t = X̃_t` for all
   large `n`, from (3.33), (3.34) and property (i) at `t`.  The hypothesis `ShiftBound` is
   exactly (3.33)–(3.34), which is the output of Step 1 (the construction (3.32) of `X̃ⁿ` from
   the times `tⁿ_j` of `UniquenessSkeleton.lean`, owned by `UniquenessGeneralSide.lean`).

4. **The assembly** (`ApproximatedBy`, `transition_eq_of_approximatedBy`,
   `identDistrib_of_approximatedBy`, `uniqueness_half`): combining 3 for `X̃` and for the
   constructed `X` with Step 1's identity in law `X̃ⁿ =ᵈ Xⁿ` identifies the transition functions
   `P_z(X̃_t = y) = P_z(X_t = y)`, and `TransitionUniqueness.identDistrib_of_transition` turns
   that into `X̃ =ᵈ X` — the uniqueness conjunct of `Theorem16Statement`.

5. **Step 2 in `L¹_loc`** (`pathClass`, `ae_tendsto_pathClass`, `pathLaw`, `tendsto_pathLaw`):
   the paper's own phrasing, "`X̃ⁿ → X̃` in law with respect to the metric (3.30)", for an
   arbitrary process — the analogue of `PathProperties.ae_tendsto_pathClassN` and
   `PathProperties.tendsto_lawN`.  Not used by 4, which goes through the transition function.

Everything that is not yet landed by the concurrent files is carried as an explicitly named
hypothesis; there is no `sorry` and no axiom.  The interface to Step 1 is `ApproximatedBy`;
the interface to the construction (3.32) of `X̃ⁿ` is `ShiftBound`.

/-! ## 1.  A jointly measurable version of `(s, ω) ↦ X_s ω`

The paper's Fubini argument in Step 2 needs `(s, ω) ↦ X̃_s ω` to be measurable for
`Borel(ℝ≥0) ⊗ 𝓕`.  Properties (i)–(vi) give only measurability of each `X̃_s`.  We construct
the version out of the dyadic ceilings `2⁻ᵏ⌈2ᵏ s⌉ ↓ s`, exactly as `StrongMarkov.lean`
constructs `dyadicLimitFuture` out of `τ_k ↓ τ`. -/

/-! ## 2.  The sojourn outside `G_n`: the right-hand side of (3.34)

`∫₀ᵗ 1(X_s ∉ G_n) ds` is the Lebesgue measure of `{s ∈ [0,t] : X_s ∉ G_n}`.  The two statements
proved here are the analytic content of the paper's sentence

> By Property (i), we have `X̃_s ∈ VG` for Lebesgue-a.e. `s ≥ 0`.  The dominated convergence
> theorem therefore implies that for each `t ≥ 0`, the right side of (3.34) goes to zero.

The first half is a Fubini exchange (property (i) says "for each `s`, a.s.", and what is needed
is "a.s., for a.e. `s`"); it is the step that needs §1.  The second half is continuity from
above along `G_n ↑ VG`. -/

/-- The right-hand side of (3.34): the Lebesgue measure of `{s ∈ [0,t] : X_s ∉ G_n}`.  (For a
process without joint measurability this is the outer measure of the set, which is all the
inequality (3.34) needs; for the version of §1 it is the measure of a measurable set.) -/

/-- **(3.33)–(3.34)** as a hypothesis relating a process to its time changes: almost surely,

and `Rⁿ ≤ ∫₀ᵗ 1(X_s ∉ G_n) ds`.

This is the output of Step 1: by the definition of the times `tⁿ_j` of (3.31), each time `t`
with `X̃_t ∈ VG_n` lies in some `[tⁿ_j, tⁿ_{j+1})`, and the time change (3.32) rewinds `t` by
the time spent outside `G_n` before `t`.  It is deliberately stated as a hypothesis: the
construction (3.32) of `X̃ⁿ` lives in `UniquenessGeneralSide.lean`. -/

almost surely `Xⁿ_t = X_t` for all sufficiently large `n`.

The proof is the paper's.  By (3.34) and `ae_tendsto_sojourn` the rewind `Rⁿ` tends to `0`
almost surely; by property (i) at `t` the path is constant on a two-sided neighbourhood
`(t − ε, t + ε)` of `t` and `X_t` is a vertex, which lies in `G_n` for all large `n` because the
`G_n` exhaust `VG`.  For `n` large enough that `Rⁿ < ε`, (3.33) reads `Xⁿ_t = X_{t − Rⁿ} = X_t`. -/

> `Xⁿ → X` in law with respect to the metric (3.30) (see the proof of existence), we get that
> `X̃ =ᵈ X`.

At the level of the laws this says: the one-time marginals `P_z(X̃_t = y)` are the limits of
`P_z(X̃ⁿ_t = y) = P_z(Xⁿ_t = y)`, which are also the limits of the one-time marginals of the
constructed process; so the two processes have the same transition function, and
`TransitionUniqueness.identDistrib_of_transition` upgrades that to equality of the laws on
path space.  (The paper passes through `L¹_loc`; by property (i) that is the same information,
as the module docstring of `Theorem16Statement.lean` records.) -/

of (3.15) on `B₁G_n` — a quantity attached to the graph, not to any particular process.  Step 1
of the uniqueness proof (the embedded chain of an arbitrary process satisfying (i)–(vi) has the
law of (3.15)) is exactly the statement that an arbitrary such process is approximated by this

> In particular, `X̃ⁿ → X̃` in law with respect to the metric (3.30).

This section is the exact analogue, for an arbitrary process satisfying the properties of
Theorem 1.6, of `PathProperties.ae_tendsto_pathClassN` and `PathProperties.tendsto_lawN` (which
are Lemma 3.8 for the *constructed* process).  The fixed-time statement of §3 upgrades to
`L¹_loc` convergence by a second Fubini exchange: for each time the set of outcomes where
`Xⁿ_t ≠ X_t` infinitely often is null, so almost surely that set of *times* is Lebesgue-null,
and bounded convergence in the finite measure `e^{-t} dt` of Definition 3.9 finishes.

`L¹_loc` convergence is not used by the assembly in §4, which goes through the transition
function; it is recorded because it is the paper's own phrasing of Step 2. -/
