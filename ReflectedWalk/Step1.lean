# Step 1 of the uniqueness proof, assembled (Gwynne–Sung, arXiv:2506.18827, p. 26)

`Theorem16.lean` proves Theorem 1.6 from one explicitly named hypothesis, `hstep1`: Step 1 of
the uniqueness proof, in the two pieces Step 1 produces — measurable time changes `X̃ⁿ` of an
arbitrary process `X̃` satisfying (i)–(vi), approximating `X̃` at fixed times
(`Theorem16.ApproximatedAtFixedTimes`), and the identity in law `X̃ⁿ =ᵈ Xⁿ` at one time, i.e.
one-time marginals given by a family `q` that does not depend on the process.  This file
**discharges `hstep1`** (`Theorem16.step1`) by joining the two files that prove its halves
independently:

* the **law side**, `UniquenessGeneralSide.lean`: the pair `((X̃_{tⁿ_j})_j, (Tⁿ_j)_j)` of the
  embedded chain of (3.31) and its holding times has the law
  `E.chainLaw hG n z ⊗ₘ holdingKernel w` (`map_embeddedPairOf_exhaustion`), so the time change
  (3.32) `processTildeN` has — after replacement by a genuinely measurable version,
  `exists_measurable_processTildeN` — the one-time marginals of the constructed chain `Xⁿ` of
  (3.15), which are the transition function `(chainFamily E w hG n).transition`
  (`ContinuousTimeChain.chainFamily_transition_eq`);
* the **pathwise side**, `TimeChange.lean`: Step 2 for the time change (3.32) `processN`,
  `approximatedAtFixedTimes_processN`, from the covering lemma and the rewind bound
  (3.33)–(3.34) in the orientation in which they hold, under two distributional hypotheses on
  the recursion (3.31): that it never gets stuck (`StepTimesFinite`, which is
  `ae_forall_definedAt` through `mem_definedAt_iff`), and that the level-`n` holding times
  diverge (`∑_j Tⁿ_j = ∞` a.s.).

The two files render (3.32) as `jumpPath` of the pair, along the stopping times of the *same*
recursion, and differ only in how the holding times are cast to `ℝ` (`holdingSeq`, through
`[0,∞)`, against `holdingSeqOf`, through `ENNReal.toReal`); `processN_eq_processTildeN` shows
that they agree wherever the recursion does not get stuck, which is almost surely.

## What is carried

One hypothesis remains, `HoldingTimesDiverge G hmin E`: the divergence `∑_j Tⁿ_j = ∞` a.s. of
the holding times of (3.31) at the levels of the exhaustion `E`, the paper's "By Property (v),
a.s. `X̃` returns to its starting point infinitely many times … a.s. `lim_k ∑_{j ≤ k} Tⁿ_j = ∞`"
(p. 26).  It is `HoldingDivergence.lean`'s `Theorem16.ae_tsum_stepHolding_eq_top`, quantified
over the rate function, the process family and the starting point; it is named here rather
than imported so that this file does not depend on a file under construction, and
`theorem16_of_holdingTimesDiverge` is closed by the substitution recorded in its docstring.

Right continuity at `∞` (`RightContinuousAtInfty`), which every theorem of
`UniquenessGeneralSide.lean` carries as `hR`, is a conjunct of `IsReflectedWalk` (the
user-approved completion of property (ii), recorded in `Theorem16Statement.lean`), and
`step1` reads it off there: `(h𝓨 v).2.2.2.1`.

The `hstep1` of `theorem16` is quantified before the antecedents `Countable V`, `Infinite V`,
`G.toSimpleGraph.Connected` of `Theorem16Statement`; the exhaustion of `G` that defines `q`
needs them (Step 1 is about countably infinite connected graphs), and they are available after
introducing the statement, which is where `theorem16_of_holdingTimesDiverge` supplies `hstep1`.

/-- **The holding times of (3.31) diverge at every level of the exhaustion `E`** (p. 26): for
every rate function `w > 0`, every process family satisfying (i)–(vi), every starting point `x`
and every level `n`, almost surely `∑_j Tⁿ_j = ∞` — "By Property (v), a.s. `X̃` returns to its
starting point infinitely many times … a.s. `lim_k ∑_{j ≤ k} Tⁿ_j = ∞`".  This is the one
distributional input of `TimeChange.approximatedAtFixedTimes_processN` that
`UniquenessGeneralSide.lean` does not supply.  It is exactly the conclusion of
`HoldingDivergence.lean`'s `Theorem16.ae_tsum_stepHolding_eq_top`, quantified over `w`, the
family and the starting point. -/

`ContinuousTimeChain.chainFamily_transition_eq` — such that every process family satisfying
(i)–(vi) is approximated at fixed times by measurable time changes with one-time marginals `q`.

`Theorem16.step1`, with the exhaustion of `G` (`Existence.exists_exhaustion`) and the discrete
σ-algebra on `V` supplied after the antecedents of `Theorem16Statement` are introduced.

The only hypothesis is the divergence of the holding times of (3.31),
`Theorem16.HoldingTimesDiverge G hmin E`, under the same antecedents (which the instances of
`HoldingDivergence.lean` need).  It is discharged by
