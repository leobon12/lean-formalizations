# Measurability of the field operations (FOUNDATIONS §9 item 3, part 1)

The σ-algebra on `𝒟'(U)` is the cylinder σ-algebra of the pairings `h ↦ ⟨h, φ⟩`
(`DistOn.measurableSpace`, D2/F1), so a map into `𝒟'(U)` is measurable iff all its pairings are
(`measurable_distOn_iff`). With this the operations `restrictTo`, `addConst`, `affineComp`,
`addFun` (jointly in `(h, f)`, `C(ℂ, ℝ)` with its Borel σ-algebra) and `ofCont` are measurable.

We also prove that a family `x ↦ Ψ x` of test functions supported in a fixed compact, whose
`y`-derivatives are jointly continuous in `(x, y)`, is continuous into `𝓓_K` and `𝓓(ℂ)`
(`continuous_testFamily`); this is the input for the joint measurability of `circleAvg` and
`heatMollify` (Carathéodory: mathlib `measurable_uncurry_of_continuous_of_measurable`).

These are standard facts with no specific published source; own elementary proofs
(the topology of `𝓓_K` is that of uniform convergence of all derivatives: mathlib
`ContDiffMapSupportedIn.continuous_iff_comp`; Heine–Cantor: `Continuous.tendstoUniformly`).
