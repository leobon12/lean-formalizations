# Versions: from a process indexed by test functions to a random distribution

Berestycki–Powell, arXiv:2404.16642, `definitionGFF.tex` l. 842–862: the GFF is first a
stochastic process `(h, ρ)` indexed by test functions, a.s. linear; a *version* of it is a random
variable in `𝒟'` whose pairings agree a.s. with the process.

`exists_version`: let `X : 𝓓(U) → Ω → ℝ` be a process with measurable coordinates such that
(i) a.s. the countably many values `(X (comb c) ω)_c` are admissible (`rangeSet U`: additive,
consistent, and of finite order on each `K_n`), and (ii) `X` is continuous in probability along
sequences converging in `𝓓(U)`. Then there is a random distribution `h : Ω → 𝒟'(U)`
(measurable for the cylinder = weak-* Borel σ-algebra) with `⟨h, φ⟩ = X φ` a.s. for every `φ`.
The random distribution is obtained by inverting the measurable embedding `pairJ`
(`measurableEmbedding_pairJ`), and (ii) transfers the identity from the countable family to all
test functions (limits in probability are a.s. unique, mathlib `tendstoInMeasure_ae_unique`).

Hypothesis (i) is where a published existence proof (BP's negative-Sobolev series, or the
Minlos/Itô regularization theorem for nuclear spaces) does its work; this file is the measurable
"version" step common to all of them. Own elementary argument.
