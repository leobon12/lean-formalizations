# Measurable continuous extension from a countable dense set (tool for the glued metric)

A function on `ℂ × ℂ` given only through its values at the points `Q a` of the dense sequence
`Q = denseSeq (ℂ × ℂ)` is turned into an element of `C(ℂ × ℂ, ℝ)`: `extQ u p` is the limit of
`u a` as `Q a → p`; if `u` is locally uniformly continuous on `Q` (`IsLUCQ`, a countable
condition) this is continuous (`continuous_extQ`), otherwise the junk value `0` is used
(`contQ`). For a continuous `F`, `contQ (F ∘ Q) = F` (`contQ_comp`), and `x ↦ contQ (u x)` is
measurable whenever each `x ↦ u x a` is (`measurable_contQ`). This replaces `toCMap`, whose
composition with a pointwise-defined family need not be measurable. Own elementary argument
(measurability is implicit in the paper, T:1349 "a measurable function `h ↦ D_h`"; DEVIATIONS).
