# DFGPS Lemma 2.9 (`lem-lfpp-tight-dyadic`, T:903–906): statement

"Let `W ⊂ ℂ` be a dyadic domain. The laws of the internal metrics `𝔞_ε⁻¹ D_h^ε(·,·;W̄)` for
`ε ∈ (0,1)` are tight w.r.t. the uniform topology on `W̄ × W̄` and any subsequential limit of
these laws is supported on length metrics which induce the Euclidean topology on `W̄`."

Readings: as `Lem2_8` (BP-DF-1), with `closedSq a s` replaced by `closure W`. The proof
(T:908) first reduces to connected `W̄` ("By considering each connected component separately, we
can assume without loss of generality that `W̄` is connected"); since metrics here are real valued
(`toReal`, junk `0` for `D = ∞` between components), the statement is made for dyadic domains with
connected closure, which is the case the proof treats (proposed DEVIATIONS entry DF-L29-CONN).
