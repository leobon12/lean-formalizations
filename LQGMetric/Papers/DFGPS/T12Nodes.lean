# DFGPS Theorem 1.2: the nodes of the assembly (D90)

Source: DFGPS arXiv:1905.00380, `lqg-metric-estimates-final.tex` ("T"), proof of Theorem 1.2,
T:1339–1386; decisions/DEC-90.md.

`T12Coupling` is the first sentence of the proof (T:1342): "Lemma 2.5 implies that for any
sequence of `ε`'s tending to zero, there is a subsequence `εₙ → 0` along which
`(h, D^{εₙ}_h) → (h, D_h)` in law". As in `Lem2_13`, `Lem2_17`, `Lem2_20` (D90), the field is
read through its coordinates `pairJ ⊤ ∘ h` (the Polish space `CoordJ → ℝ`, on which Prokhorov's
theorem applies; DV-D90), and the limit is realized on one probability space together with the
same field `h`, which is the form those lemmas consume.

/-- **DFGPS T:1342** (Step 0 of the proof of Theorem 1.2): along a subsequence of any `ε → 0`,
`(h, 𝔞_ε⁻¹ D^ε_h)` converges in law to a coupling `(h, D_h)` with the same normalized field. -/
