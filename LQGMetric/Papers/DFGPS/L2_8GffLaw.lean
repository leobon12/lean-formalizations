# Laws of continuous Gaussian paths (DFGPS L2.8, step (a1): transport across couplings)

DFGPS (T:880–881) uses DDDF Theorem 1 and DDDF Proposition 29 (`Blueprint.DDDFProp29`), whose
coupling lives on its own probability space. To transport statements about laws we need: the law
of the path of a process with continuous paths, as a random element of `C(ℂ, ℝ)`, is determined
by its finite-dimensional distributions; for Gaussian processes by means and covariances.

* `pathC` : the path `ω ↦ (x ↦ Y x ω)` as an element of `C(ℂ, ℝ)`; `measurable_pathC`;
* `map_pathC_eq_of_gaussian` : two Gaussian processes with continuous paths and equal means and
  covariances have equal path laws (restriction to a dense sequence is a measurable embedding of
  the Polish space `C(ℂ, ℝ)`, mathlib `Continuous.measurableEmbedding`, and laws on `ℕ → ℝ` are
  determined by means and covariances, `KilledHeat.map_eq_of_gaussian`);
* `map_pathC_heat_eq` : for continuous versions of the heat-smoothed zero-boundary GFF
  `x ↦ Xh (p_s(x − ·) 1_D)` on two probability spaces.

Standard (e.g. Kallenberg, *Foundations of Modern Probability*, 2nd ed., Prop. 2.2 + Lemma 1.17
for the uniqueness of laws on `C` given the finite-dimensional ones); here assembled from mathlib.
