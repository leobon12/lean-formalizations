# DFGPS Proposition 4.1, Step 4: the circle-average sum estimate (4.5) for Gaussian vectors

Source: Dubédat–Falconet–Gwynne–Pfeffer–Sun, arXiv:1905.00380, `lqg-metric-estimates-final.tex`,
proof of Proposition 4.1, Step 4 (T:2507–2582): after Paley–Zygmund (`probB_ge`), DFGPS Lemma 4.2
(= DZZ Lemma 2.1, `GaussConc.dzz_lemma21_strong`) is applied with
`B = {x : ∑ e^{ξ x_k} ≥ a ε^{-1-ξ²/2}}`, `σ² = max Var X_k ≤ log ε⁻¹ + O(1)` and
`λ = (p/ξ) log ε⁻¹` (T:2565–2580; here `λ = (p log ε⁻¹ + min(log a, 0))/ξ`, which absorbs the
constant `a` exactly as the "≥ a ε^{p-1-ξ²/2}" of T:2578 does into the `o_ε(1)`).

`sumExp_lower`: for a centered Gaussian vector `(X_k)_{k<n}` with `n ≥ κ/ε`,
`Var X_k ≥ log ε⁻¹ - A₀` and `Cov(X_j,X_k) ≤ log ε⁻¹ - log(|j-k|+1) + A₀`,
`P[∑_k e^{ξ X_k} < ε^{p-1-ξ²/2}] ≤ ε^{p²/(2ξ²) - ζ}` for `ε < ε₀(ξ,κ,A₀,p,ζ)`
(this is (4.5), T:2496–2499, for `X_k = h_{ε𝕣}(z_k) - h_𝕣(0)`).
