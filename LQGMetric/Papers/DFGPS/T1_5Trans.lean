# DFGPS Theorem 1.5, Step 1: moving the centre of an event (law transfer without measurability)

DFGPS (arXiv:1905.00380, "T"), proof of Theorem 1.5, Step 1 (T:1662–1670) applies Proposition 3.1
"and a union bound over all `z ∈ (𝕣𝕊) ∩ (δ𝕣ℤ²)`": Prop 3.1 is stated at the centre `0`, and is
used at the centres `z` through the translation invariance of the law of `h` (`h(· + z) - h_1(z)`
is again a normalized whole-plane GFF) with constants not depending on `z`.

`DFGPS.Prop3_1` gives its constants for each realization `(Ω, P, h)` separately. We work on the
canonical space `Ω = DistC` with `P = μ` the law of a normalized whole-plane GFF and `h = id`; the
translation `T_z g = g(· + z) - g_1(z)` preserves `μ` (`map_affine_sub_circleAvg`), so for every
set `S` (measurable or not) `μ (T_z⁻¹ S) ≤ μ S` (`Measure.le_map_apply`). Hence the constants of
Prop 3.1 for `(DistC, μ, id)` bound the probabilities of the translated events for all `z` at
once, with no measurability of the events needed.
