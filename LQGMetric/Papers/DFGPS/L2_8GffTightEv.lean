# Tightness transfer with domination on events of probability close to one (DFGPS L2.8, (a1))

DFGPS T:883–891 compares `D^ε_h` with `D^ε_{h̊}` through the localized metrics; the comparison
holds only for `ε` below a random threshold `ε₀(ω)`. Hence, for `ε < ε₁` with deterministic
`ε₁`, the domination `B_ε ≤ K · A_ε` holds on the event `{ε₀ ≥ ε₁}`, whose probability is close to
one for small `ε₁`. This file extends `isTightMeasureSet_of_le_mul` (`L2_8ProofTight.lean`) to
this situation (own elementary argument; the paper does not discuss it):

* `isTightMeasureSet_of_approx` : a family dominated, up to `η`, on compact complements by a
  tight family, for every `η > 0`, is tight;
* `isTightMeasureSet_of_le_mul_ev` : tightness transfer with domination `B_i ≤ M · A_i` on
  events `E_i` (arbitrary sets, depending on `i`) with `P(E_iᶜ) ≤ η` (one constant `M` per `η`).
  Per-`ε` probability bounds therefore suffice: no simultaneity in `ε` is needed.
