# DG:1774–1777, 1593–1595: law transfer between zero-boundary GFFs (task P2-DG105q)

DG pass from P3.22 / P3.17 for the coupling `(ĥ, h^{𝕊(1)})` to "the same is true with a
whole-plane GFF" (DG:1776, DG:1593–1595). The LFPP events only see a version of the circle
averages of `h^{𝕊(1)}` on a closed square `X`, and the law of a zero-boundary GFF is unique.

* `r18_circ_factor` — `T ↦ T_r(z)` factors measurably through `T|_U` when `∂B_r(z) ⊆ U`
  (from `GM.measurable_circleAvg_fieldSigma` with `h = id` and mathlib's
  `Measurable.exists_eq_measurable_comp`);
* `r18_law_eq` — two fields whose restrictions to `U` are zero-boundary GFFs
  (`IsZeroBoundaryGFF.map_eq`) have equal laws of countably many circle averages;
* `r18Cl` — the clamping retraction of `ℂ` onto the square `[a,b]²`;
* **`r18_transfer`** — for a functional `F` with the comparison property `T18Cmp` that only
  depends on `[a,b]²`, `P{F(hc) ∈ S} = P'{F(hc') ∈ S}` for continuous versions `hc, hc'` of the
  circle averages of the two fields.

Own routine glue (DV-D105m-1 pattern: measurability of the LFPP events in countably many
coordinates, which DG use silently).
