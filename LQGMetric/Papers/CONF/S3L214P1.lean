# CONF Lemma 2.14 for connected subsets of the circle (decision D120 §1.3, packet J1)

Gwynne–Miller, *Confluence of geodesics in LQG* (arXiv:1905.00381), Lemma 2.14,
`confluence-final.tex` C:832–894, in the located form `confL214Loc_of_jordanMap` (S3T39I3),
applied to arbitrary pairwise disjoint nonempty connected subsets `Jᵢ` of the unit circle instead
of arcs `circArc θᵢ ℓᵢ` (CONF allows open, half-open and closed arcs, C:1516; degenerate arcs as in
DEC-120 §1.3):

* `t39p_circle_preconnected`: a preconnected proper nonempty subset of `S¹` lies between an open
  arc and its closure (`circArcOpen θ ℓ ⊆ J ⊆ circArc θ ℓ`, `ℓ ≥ 0`); own elementary argument
  (via `arg`), standard.
* `t39p_point_good`: a one-point arc `{Φ b}` is disconnected from `0` in `U = Φ(𝔻)` by a set of
  arbitrarily small diameter near `∂U` (`t39i_arc_loc` with `ℓ → 0`, continuity of `Φ` at `b`).
* `t39p_L214_conn`: Lemma 2.14 (located) for the family `Φ(Jᵢ)`; L2.14 is applied to the
  positive-length arcs with `C' = C (n/n')^{-1/2}`, the one-point arcs are all good.
