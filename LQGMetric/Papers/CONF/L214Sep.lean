# CONF Lemma 2.14, node R4: crosscut separation in the disc

Gwynne–Miller, *Confluence of geodesics in LQG* (arXiv:1905.00381), proof of Lemma 2.14,
confluence-final.tex 866–869: the set joining `φ(J_I⁻)` to `φ(J_I⁺)` inside `φ(H_I)` "divides
`U` into at least two connected components" and, since it avoids the diameter of `H_I` (where
`0` lies), "it must disconnect 0 from `I`". In disc coordinates (`l214_sep`): let `W` be a
connected open subset of the upper half-disc whose closure contains two points `a, b` of the
unit circle, and let `A` be a set of circle points `q'` in the upper half-plane lying strictly
counterclockwise of `a` and clockwise of `b` within a half-turn (`Im(a q̄') < 0 < Im(b q̄')`).
Then every path from `0` to a point of `A` that stays in the open disc except at points of `A`
meets `closure W`.

Proof (own argument; the paper says "necessarily"): otherwise, join `a` to `b` through `W` by a
path avoiding the given path `γ` (short segments to `a, b` and a path in `W`), stop `γ` at its
first boundary point `q' ∈ A`, prepend the segment from `−s₀ q'` to `0` (lower half-disc), and
map everything by `z ↦ i (q' + z)/(q' − z)` to the upper half-plane; QuantumZipper's crossing
lemma `lwfSide_crossing` (winding numbers, Burckel Def. 4.2) then forces an intersection.
