# CONF Theorem 3.9, packet J6d, node O2: `DisconnectsFromInfty` through countable data

Gwynne–Miller, *Confluence of geodesics in LQG* (arXiv:1905.00381), `confluence-final.tex`,
C:1586. For `K` closed, bounded, with Jordan frontier and `J ⊆ ∂K`, the event "`B̄_a(c)`
disconnects `J` from `∞` in `ℂ ∖ K`" (`DisconnectsFromInfty`) is expressed through countably many
hit events of `K` and `J` (**`k8_disc_iff`**): for some `n` with `K ⊆ B̄_{n-1}(0)` and every `m`
there is `k` such that every rational point `q` joined to `{‖·‖ > n}` by an admissible chain of
balls (`k8W`) and within `1/(k+1)` of `J` is within `a + 1/(m+1)` of `c`.

Topological input: `T39K8LocAccess`, the uniform local accessibility of a Jordan curve from the
unbounded complementary component (from Carathéodory's extension of the exterior conformal map to
the closed exterior disc; Pommerenke, *Boundary Behaviour of Conformal Maps* (1992), Thm 2.6 and
Prop. 2.3 — every Jordan domain is locally connected at its boundary). The proof of `k8_disc_iff`
from it is an own elementary argument (CONF gives none).
