# DZZ Lemma 3.13 from its geometric part (P2-DZZ313)

Ding–Zeitouni–Zhang, arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex` l. 1314–1340 (Lemma 3.13 and proof).

The proof has two parts. (G) the construction (l. 1327–1334) of the box sequence `B_{j,i}` inside the
good cell sequence and the geometric check behind (Eq.fine-field-independent) (l. 1334–1336:
`s_B log(1/s_B) < ε* s_𝖢 / 10`, goodness): this is the open node `L313Geom`, stated with the
space-time regions of `S3L13Reg`. (P) the probabilistic content of (Eq.fine-field-independent) and of
the conclusion ("the construction of `𝒱_δ` does not explore the white noise of the fine field, completing
the proof"), proved here (`dzz_lemma313_of_geom`):

* the sequence is selected as a function of the cell predicate (`l313Sel`), so `{seq = l₀}` is
  `σ(𝒱_δ)`-measurable;
* stopping-set argument: with `M'(b) = M(b)` if `boxReg b` misses `fineReg l₀` and `M'(b) = 0`
  otherwise, `M'` is measurable for the white noise off `fineReg l₀`, and on `{seq = l₀}` the partitions
  of `M` and `M'` coincide (`isCell_eq_of_eqOn_explored`), so every `σ(𝒱_δ)`-event inside `{seq = l₀}`
  is an event of the white noise off `fineReg l₀`;
* that σ-algebra is independent of the fine field (`indep_wnSigma_compl`), and
  `ae_condExp_indicator_eq_of_indep` concludes.
Own elementary formalization of these standard steps (DZZ give no details).
