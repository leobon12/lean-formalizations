# DZZ Lemma 3.5: the `i_r` recursion on the square grid (P2-DEC84, D84)

Ding–Zeitouni–Zhang (arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex` l. 1071–1079): "let
`i_1 = max {i : ℂ_i encloses u}`, and define recursively `i_r = max {i > i_{r-1} : ℂ_i
intersects ℂ_{i_{r-1}}}` till `r_0` such that one can not define `i_{r_0+1}`, then `A_δ` is
connected to `ℂ_start ∪ ℂ_{i_1}` and respectively `B_δ` to `ℂ_end ∪ ℂ_{i_{r_0}}`."

On the level-`N` grid (decision D84, DEC-84 §4), with rings `Ring i` of squares around the cells
`C i` (`i < d`) and a 4-path `p 0, …, p M` of squares through `C 0, …, C (d-1)` in order:

* `Tch X Y`: two sets of squares share a square or contain 4-adjacent squares.
* **`l35_recursion`**: DZZ's chain `i_1 < … < i_{r_0}` of touching rings exists, `p 0` is
  enclosed by (or on) `Ring i_1` and `p M` by (or on) `Ring i_{r_0}`. The last claim (DZZ: "then
  `B_δ` is connected to `ℂ_{i_{r_0}}`") is proved by contradiction with the nesting `not_esc_nest`.

Own argument (DZZ's sketch made rigorous); DEVIATIONS DV-D84.

/-- **DZZ's `i_r` recursion** (l. 1071–1079) on the level-`N` grid. Rings `Ring i` enclose the
squares of the cells `C i` (`i < d`, F1), are 4-connected, and `p 0, …, p M` is a path of squares
(equal or 4-adjacent consecutive ones) through `C 0, …, C (d - 1)` in order. Then there is a
chain `g 0 < … < g r` of touching rings with `p 0` enclosed by `Ring (g 0)` and `p M` enclosed by
`Ring (g r)` (in `C_large`; squares on a ring count as enclosed). -/
