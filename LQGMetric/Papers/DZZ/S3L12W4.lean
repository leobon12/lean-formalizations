# DZZ Lemma 3.12: geometry of the three parents (D93, packet P-5/P-8)

Ding–Zeitouni–Zhang, arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex`, proof of Lemma 3.12, l. 1462–1497:
`𝖡_lt` (diagonal to the parent `𝖡_rb ⊃ 𝖢`) and `𝖡_rt`, `𝖡_lb` (sharing an edge with `𝖡_rb`).

* `quad_facts`, `quad_eq`: integer description of the quadrant boxes;
* `diag_inter_parent`: a cell containing the diagonal quadrant and no other quadrant meets the
  parent box of `𝖢` only at `z*`.

Own elementary arguments (integer arithmetic), DV-D93.
