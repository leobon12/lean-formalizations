# DZZ Lemma 5.4 from the point-to-segment bound (P2-DZZ54)

Ding–Zeitouni–Zhang, arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex`, Lemma 5.4
(`lem-exponent-point-to-boundary`, statement l. 2299–2304, proof l. 2530–2578).

DZZ's proof has two steps.
1. (eq-point-to-segment), l. 2545–2550: for fixed small `ι` and all small `δ`, every segment
   `L_δ ⊆ ∂𝕍̄_u` of length in `[δ^{2ι}/2, δ^{2ι}]` has
   `E log min_{x ∈ L_δ} D̄_δ(u,x) ≥ (χ − 2ι) log δ⁻¹`. The proof (l. 2551–2568) is by contradiction,
   gluing geodesics and four short RSW crossings (Fig. glue) with the scaling argument of
   (eq-z-open). Here it is the hypothesis `DZZLem54Seg` (open node).
2. l. 2570–2577: `∂𝕍̄_u` is the union of `≈ 4δ^{−2ι}` such segments; Proposition 3.17 applied to the
   pairs `(u, L_δ)` and a union bound give the lower bound. This file proves step 2
   (`dzzLem54_lower`), with Proposition 3.17 (`DZZProp317`, at the walled measure of
   `𝕍_{u,1/10}`, DZZ Remark 5.2) as hypothesis.

Two technical points of the Lean proof (the argument is DZZ's):
* Proposition 3.17 is a statement about one admissible *sequence* `(A_δ, B_δ)`, with a threshold
  `δ₀` that depends on the sequence. To get a bound that holds uniformly over the `4n(δ)` segments,
  we apply it to the sequence `B_δ =` the segment with the largest deviation probability at
  scale `δ` (`idx`), and bound the union by `4n(δ)` times that probability.
* DZZ's last step ("this implies `E log min ≥ (χ − 2ι − Cι^{1/2}) log δ⁻¹`") goes from a bound
  that holds with high probability to a bound on the mean. We do it with Proposition 3.17 for the
  pair `(u, ∂𝕍̄_u)`: an `ω` in both good events gives the mean bound. This needs no
  integrability hypothesis.
We choose the concentration level `ι' = min(ε/4, 1/2)` first and then `ι ≤ cι'²/4`. DZZ do the
reverse, with `ι' = Cι^{1/2}`; the two choices are equivalent.
