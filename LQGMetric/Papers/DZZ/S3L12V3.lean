# DZZ Lemma 3.16, (eq-B-percolation), crossing form (D93, packet P-4, coarse form)

Ding–Zeitouni–Zhang, arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex` l. 1365–1371 (statement), l. 1381–1397
(proof). The proof of `dzz_lemma316_perc` (S3L316P4: same parameters `ε = 2^{-k}`,
`t = ε* = 2^{-(k + k'')}`, `a = 1.2 log t⁻¹`, `θ = t^{1/100}`, same asymptotics, copied
verbatim), ending with the crossing form of the Peierls step `l316_cross_open` instead of
`l316_enc_open`, and keeping the coarse crossings (`HasCrossRing`) instead of passing to the
enclosure by `hasEnclosure_ring`.

* `dzz_lemma316_cross : DZZLemma316Cross P γ W`;
  `dzzLemma316Perc_of_cross` (S3L12V2) recovers `dzz_lemma316_perc`.
