# `P32StartGeom`, steps 3–4: DZZ's row of balls and the assembly (P2-DZZ32G)

DZZ (arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex` l. 1149–1151): "The collection of these balls covers a
line segment from `x` to `∂B_large`, and each ball is covered by at most 4 boxes in `{B̂_j}`."
At `μIn` the path is the escape chain `x → x' = pushIn h x` (S3P32G2, DV-ETA2d) followed by DZZ's
horizontal segment `x' → w = (c_B.re ± s_B, x'.im) ∈ ∂B_large`, covered by `8·2^{N-n_B}+1` balls of
radius `h/2` (`h = 2^{-N}`); every ball lies in `≤ 4` level-`N` boxes (`four_box`).

* **`p32StartGeomS`**: `P32StartGeomS`, i.e. `P32StartGeom` with the extra hypothesis
  `r ≤ s_B / 2` (always true where it is used: `r = rP32 γ δ ≤ δ^{C_mc}/8 ≤ s_B/8` for cells).
* **`not_p32StartGeom`**: `P32StartGeom` as stated in S3P32F5 is false (`r = 1/2`, `x = (1/2,1/2)`:
  `𝕍_{−1/2} = {x}` contains no path to `∂B_large`).
