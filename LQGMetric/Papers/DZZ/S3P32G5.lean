# `L32StartPhiHPC` at `μIn`, unconditional (P2-DZZ32G)

Copy of `l32StartPhiHPC_of_geom` (S3P32F7, P2-DZZ32F) using `start_bound_explicitS` (S3P32G4,
with the proved cover `p32StartGeomS`) instead of the false hypothesis `P32StartGeom`.


DZZ (arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex` l. 1149–1153): `t = 2^{-q}` with `2^q ≤ δ^{-ι/2} < 2^{q+1}`
(DZZ: `t = 2^{-⌈log₂(δ^{-ι/2} λ)⌉}`; the factor `λ` is not needed, DV-P32F1), `ι = C_Mc/2`.
The bound `9K · 16 M t² e^E` of `start_bound_explicit` is `≤ δ^{ι/4}` for small `δ`
(DZZ: `(6/t + 6) t^{1.9} ≤ δ^{ι/10}`), and `M = 8/t + O(log δ⁻¹) ≤ δ^{-ι} λ`.
