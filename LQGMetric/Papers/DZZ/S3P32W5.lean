# D97, packet P-3: (eq-Euclidean-Ball-covering) from (eq-cell-LQG-compare)

DZZ (arXiv:1807.00422, `LBM_LGDarXiv.tex` l. 1173–1183): "any Euclidean ball `R` of radius `r` can
be covered by four closed dyadic boxes … of side length `s = 2 min{2^{-n} : 2^{-n} ≥ r}`. Suppose
that `R` cannot be covered by four cells in `𝒱_{δ'}`, which means at least one of these four
dyadic boxes `B` satisfies `M_{γ,s}(B) > δ'²`. Further, partition the box concentric with `B` of
side length `4s` into `(4 × 2^{10})²` squares of side length `s' = 2^{-10} s`. Denote the partition
by `𝒮_B`. Then, `R` contains at least one square from `𝒮_B`. Therefore, (eq-Euclidean-Ball-covering)
would follow provided that with high probability (eq-cell-LQG-compare) there exists no dyadic
box `B` with `M_{γ,s}(B) > δ'²` and `M_γ(S) ≤ δ²` for some `S ∈ 𝒮_B`."

* `sqSB B a b` (`a, b < 4096`): the closed squares of `𝒮_B`;
* `cellCompareEvent γ W ν δ`: (eq-cell-LQG-compare), for the squares `S ∈ 𝒮_B` **inside `𝕍`**
  and with `M_{γ,s}(B) ≥ δ'²` (the boxes which are not inside a cell of `𝒱_{δ'}`);
* **`ballInCells_of_compare`** (deterministic): on (eq-cell-LQG-compare), every ball inside `𝕍`
  of mass `≤ δ²` is covered by 4 cells (the closed level-`n` boxes meeting the ball, `2^{-n}`
  between `2r` and `4r`, are at most 4; each of them has `m < δ'²`, so lies in a cell);
* **`l32BallCover_of_cellCompare`**: (eq-cell-LQG-compare) w.h.p. gives `L32BallCover` at
  `dzzWall dzzV ν`.

Boundary boxes (DEC-97 doubts): for a box `B` at `∂𝕍` some squares of `𝒮_B` lie outside `𝕍`,
where `M_γ` has no mass, so DZZ's (eq-cell-LQG-compare) over *all* `S ∈ 𝒮_B` would fail there.
Their argument only uses a square `S ⊆ R ⊆ 𝕍`, so we quantify over `S ⊆ 𝕍` (reading).
