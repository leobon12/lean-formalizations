# GM.S4.6: the geodesic `P` enters a ball `B_{λ₂r}(z)` with `(z,r) ∈ 𝒵_k` and `E_r(z)`

Source: GM = `literature/src/1905.00383/uniqueness-final.tex`, proof of Proposition 4.12,
l. 2229–2234: "By condition 5 … each point of `∂B_{2λ₄ε𝕣}(𝓑^•_{t_k})` is contained in a
Euclidean ball `B_{λ₂r}(z)` for some `(z,r) ∈ 𝒵_k` for which `E_r(z)` occurs. … the union of
these Euclidean balls disconnects `∂𝓑^•_{t_k}` from `𝕨`. Therefore, `P` must enter
`B_{λ₂r}(z)` for some `(z,r) ∈ 𝒵_k` such that `E_r(z)` occurs." (GM_B: GM.S4.6.)

Own elementary write-up of GM's unstated step: `u ↦ dist(P(u), K)` is continuous, `0` at
`P(0) = 𝕫 ∈ K` and large at `P(L) = 𝕨`, so `P` hits the level set `{dist(·, K) = d₀}`; a grid
point `z ∈ (λ₁ε^{1+ν}𝕣/4)ℤ²` within `λ₁ε^{1+ν}𝕣/2` of that point (`gm_exists_gridPt_near`) has a
good radius `r` by condition 5, and `λ₁ε^{1+ν}𝕣/2 < λ₂ r`.

Reading (proposed DEVIATIONS entry): GM cover the level set at `d₀ = 2λ₄ε𝕣`, but the grid point
`z` near it can then have `dist(z, ∂𝓑^•_{t_k}) > 2λ₄ε𝕣`, outside the range (4.10) of `𝒵_k`; we
use any level `d₀` with `[d₀ − 2σ, d₀ + 2σ] ⊆ [λ₄ε𝕣, 2λ₄ε𝕣]` (`σ = λ₁ε^{1+ν}𝕣/4`; e.g.
`d₀ = (3/2)λ₄ε𝕣` for small `ε`).

* `gm_infDist_frontier_eq` — for `K` closed and `z ∉ K`, `dist(z, ∂K) = dist(z, K)`.
* `gm_S4_6_det` — the deterministic statement.
