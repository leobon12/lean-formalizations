# GM Proposition 4.12 on `ℰ_𝕣` with `hfin` discharged (DEC-86 (3))

`p412b_stab_of_ext` and `p412b_core` (P2-M2J2b) took `hfin` (avoid-geodesics have finite
`D_h`-length) as an open input. DEC-86 (3): on `ℰ_𝕣` it follows from GM's condition 3
(l. 1958–1962, `regC3`) via `p412e_hfin_regC3`, provided `∂B_r(z) ⊆ B_{4ℓ𝕣}(𝕣V)`.

* `p412e_sphere_mem_cthickening`: for `(z, r) ∈ 𝒵_k` with `r ≤ ε𝕣`, `∂B_r(z)` lies in the
  `4λ₄ε𝕣`-neighbourhood of `𝓑^•_{t_k}` (GM (4.10): `dist(z, ∂𝓑^•_{t_k}) ≤ 2λ₄ε𝕣`).
* `p412e_stab_of_ext`: `p412b_stab_of_ext` with `hfin` replaced by `∂B_r(z) ⊆ B_{4ℓ𝕣}(𝕣V)`.
* `p412e_core`: `p412b_core` with `hfin` removed; its regularity-region hypothesis is taken for
  the `4λ₄ε𝕣`- instead of the `2λ₄ε𝕣`-neighbourhood of `𝓑^•_{t_k}` (both follow from
  `t_k ≤ τ_{2ℓ𝕣}` and `ε` small; the proof is that of `p412b_core`).
