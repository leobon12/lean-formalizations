# Accessibility of boundary points from (LC) (for GM L4.13′, "possibly shrinking `X₀`")

GM L4.13 proof (l. 2075–2076): "By possibly shrinking `X₀`, we can assume without loss of
generality that `Cl'(X₀) ∩ (∂𝓑^•_s ∖ I)` is a single prime end". For a Jordan boundary
(D86: prime ends = points) we realise this by replacing `X₀` with a path in `ℂ ∖ K` that ends at
the boundary point `v` and stays near `X₀`; the tail near `v` comes from (LC) at `v`
(`p412c_filledBall_locConnAt`), by concatenating countably many paths in shrinking balls.

* `p412e_concat_shrink`: `p412e_concat` with shrinking images instead of summable lengths.
* `p412e_path_in_open`: a preconnected `C` inside an open `O ⊆ ℂ` is joined by paths in `O`.
* `p412e_access`: (LC) at `v ∈ cl(ℂ ∖ K)` ⇒ points near `v` are joined to `v` by a path in
  `B_δ(v)` that stays in `ℂ ∖ K` before its endpoint.
Own elementary arguments (standard; DV-L413-shrink proposed).
