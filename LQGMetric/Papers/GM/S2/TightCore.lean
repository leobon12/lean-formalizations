# GM S2.4, abstract core: uniform smallness on a compact set of laws (task P2-TIGHT)

GM (arXiv:1905.00383v3, `uniqueness-final.tex` l. 449–452) and DFGPS (arXiv:1904.08021,
`T:370–374`) assert without proof that Axiom V "implies the tightness of various functionals".
Decision D-A3 (`decisions/DEC-A.md` (c)) splits the claim into S2.4a–e. The common step of
S2.4a and S2.4b is the following abstract fact, proved here.

* `upperSemicontinuous_measure_closed`: for a closed set `F`, `μ ↦ μ F` is upper semicontinuous
  on probability measures (Portmanteau, mathlib
  `ProbabilityMeasure.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_tendsto` with the filter `𝓝 μ`).
* `exists_measure_lt_of_isCompact_closure`: if `S` has compact closure (Prokhorov) and `C n` is a
  decreasing sequence of closed sets with `μ (⋂ C n) = 0` for every `μ ∈ closure S`, then for
  every `ε > 0` some `C n` has `ν (C n) < ε` for all `ν ∈ S` (a Dini-type argument: the closed
  sets `{μ ∈ closure S | ε ≤ μ (C n)}` decrease and have empty intersection, so by Cantor's
  intersection theorem one of them is empty).
* `exists_mem_iInter_of_not_mapsTo`: in `C(X, Y)`, if `d` fails `MapsTo d (A n) (U n)` for every
  `n` (compact `A n` decreasing, open `U n` increasing), then some `x ∈ ⋂ A n` has
  `d x ∉ U n` for all `n` (Cantor again).

This replaces the subsequence/Portmanteau argument of D-A3 by its compactness form (same
ingredients: Prokhorov, Portmanteau, closure property of Axiom V). Own argument (no source
proves S2.4); DEVIATIONS entry DA5.
