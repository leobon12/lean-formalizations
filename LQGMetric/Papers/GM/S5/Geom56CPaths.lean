# GM Lemma 5.6: the Euclidean paths `π₋`, `π₊`, as a statement (task P2-M2L56b)

GM = Gwynne–Miller, arXiv:1905.00383, `literature/src/1905.00383/uniqueness-final.tex`, proof of
Lemma 5.6, l. 2963–2966: "let `v' := (3/2)(v − z) + z`, `L₋` the segment from `z` to `u`, `L₊` the
segment from `v` to `v'`. We can choose a path `π₋` from `z − 2r` to `z` and a path `π₊` from `v'`
to `z + 2r` in `B_{2r}(z)` such that the Euclidean distances from `π₋ ∪ π₊` to `H_r(z)` and from
`π₋ ∪ L₋` to `π₊ ∪ L₊` are each at least `b r`."

`L56Paths` is this sentence, the planar (grid-free) part of the construction of `V_r(z)`, with
`π±` preconnected sets in the closed ball `cl B_{2r}(z)` (as in D69, condition (1) of `L56GeomN`
uses the closed ball) and a constant `b > 0` depending only on `α` (GM take `b = 1 − α`; only
`b > 0` is used). Open node, analogous to `L58Paths` (Geom58Paths.lean); the grid assembly
`L56Paths → L56ConstrN` is described in `handoff/P2-M2L56.md`.
