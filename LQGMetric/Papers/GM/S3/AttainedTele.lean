# GM §3.3: the telescoping bound (3.17) along a `D`-geodesic
(task P2-M2F, WP-M2f, row 8 of `blueprint/M2.md`)

GM = Gwynne–Miller, arXiv:1905.00383v3, proof of Proposition 3.6, Steps 2–3 (l. 1440–1488).

Deterministic core of GM's Steps 2–3. GM defines times `t_0 = 0 < t_1 < …` (`t_j` = first exit
of a good ball `B_{r_j}(w_j)` with `P(t_{j−1}) ∈ B_{r_j/2}(w_j)`, `s_j` = last visit of
`∂B_{αr_j}(w_j)` before `t_j`), shows (3.14) `D̃(P(s_j), P(t_j)) ≤ C'(t_j − s_j)`,
`D̃(P(t_{j−1}), P(s_j)) ≤ C_*(s_j − t_{j−1})`, (3.16) `s_j − t_{j−1} ≤ A/(A+1)(t_j − t_{j−1})`, and
sums (3.17). We run the same recursion as an induction on the number of steps:

* `tele_step`: one step `a = t_{j−1} ↦ t = t_j` (with `s = s_j`):
  `D̃(P(a), P(t)) ≤ (C' + A/(A+1)(C_* − C'))(t − a)` and `|P(t) − P(a)| ≥ r/2`;
* `tele_core`: the sum (3.17) from `a₀` to `b₀`: every step advances by at least the
  uniform-continuity modulus `δ₀` of `P` at Euclidean scale `r_min/2`, so finitely many steps
  reach `b₀`; the last, incomplete step (when `P(b₀)` is already in the good ball) costs at
  most `C_* ω`, where `ω` bounds `b₀ − a = D(P(a), P(b₀))` for such `a`. (GM handles the two ends
  through `J̲`, `J̄` and (3.15), (3.18); we keep the end errors explicit as `ω`.)

The comparison input (3.14) enters as the hypothesis `hcomp` (from condition 1 of `𝖤_r(w)` and
GM.S3.7, for a sub-path staying in the closed annulus).
