# Events of a local random object are local events (task P2-LOCMEAS, decision D51)

The shared measurability step behind GM Lemma 3.7 ("`𝖤_r(z)` is determined by
`h|_{𝔸_{r/2,2r}(z)}`", GM arXiv:1905.00383v3 l. 1345–1360), GM Lemma 4.6 and DFGPS Lemma 3.2.
Axiom II (locality) only says that the internal metric `D_h(·,·;U)` is a.s. a measurable function
of `h|_U`, coordinatewise. Events quantifying over all points and paths become `σ(h|_U)`-events
as follows (the argument of P2-E3a's `GM.gm_ae_preimage_eq_of_saturated`, extended to
universally measurable events):

* `Y : Ω → β` (the field, `β` standard Borel), `R : β → γ'` Borel (the internal metric at the
  pairs of a countable dense set, read off `Y`), `W ⊆ β` Borel carrying the law of `Y` on which
  `R` determines the event `B` (`B` saturated: continuity of internal metrics, LM Lemma 1.1).
* `ae_preimage_eq_of_saturated`: if `W ∩ B` is Borel, the images `R(W ∩ B)` and `R(W ∖ B)` are
  disjoint analytic sets, separated by a Borel `S` (Lusin separation, mathlib
  `AnalyticSet.measurablySeparable`; Kechris, *Classical Descriptive Set Theory*, Thm 14.7);
  then `{Y ∈ B} = {R(Y) ∈ S}` a.s. Proof copied from P2-E3a's
  `GM.gm_ae_preimage_eq_of_saturated` (`Papers/GM/S4/L46Meas.lean`), to keep `Meas/` free of
  paper imports.
* `ae_preimage_eq_of_saturated_null`: the same when `B` is only null-measurable for the law of
  `Y` (e.g. universally measurable: analytic/coanalytic events over paths, decision D30):
  shrink `W` by the null Borel set `B₂ ∖ B₁` between a Borel kernel and hull of `B`.
* `aeEventIn_of_saturated`: if moreover `V = R(Y)` a.s. with `V` measurable for a σ-algebra `m`
  (locality: `V` is the internal metric computed from `h|_U`), then `{Y ∈ B}` is a.s. an event of
  `m` (`Blueprint.AEEventIn`).

Standard descriptive set theory (no paper proof to follow; own short arguments around mathlib's
separation theorem).
