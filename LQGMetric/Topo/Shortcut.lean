# Paths crossing disconnecting sets: GM (3.16) and GM §4.6 (F.TOPO II)

* `exists_mem_of_disconnects`: a path `P : [a, b] → ℂ` from `E` to `F` meets every set
  disconnecting `E` from `F` (immediate from `Disconnects`, after reparametrizing `[a, b]` by
  `[0, 1]`).
* **GM (3.16)** (Gwynne–Miller, *Existence and uniqueness of the LQG metric*, arXiv:1905.00383,
  `uniqueness-final.tex` lines 1467–1477): `shortcut_le` and `shortcut_le_frac`. A geodesic
  crossing an annulus once before time `t_{j-1}` and once during `[s_j, t_j]` hits a
  disconnecting path `L` at times `u₁ ≤ t_{j-1}` and `u₂ ≥ s_j`; since it is a geodesic,
  `s_j - t_{j-1} ≤ u₂ - u₁ = D(P(u₁), P(u₂)) ≤ len(L)`. We follow GM's argument; the length of
  `L` enters only through `D(x, y) ≤ ℓ` for `x, y ∈ L` (use `edist_le_curveLength`).
* **GM §4.6** (`uniqueness-final.tex` lines 2232–2236): `disconnects_of_frontier_thickening`. A set
  covering the boundary `∂B_δ(K)` of the open `δ`-neighbourhood of `K` disconnects `K` from every
  point outside the closed `δ`-neighbourhood. (GM: "if `ε` is sufficiently small then the union of
  these Euclidean balls disconnects `∂𝓑^•_{t_k}` from `𝕨`"; own elementary argument: a connected
  path range meeting the interior and the exterior of a set meets its frontier.)
