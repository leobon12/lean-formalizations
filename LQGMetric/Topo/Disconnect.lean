# Disconnecting sets and the distance around an annulus (DFGPS Definition 3.7)

DFGPS (Dubédat–Falconet–Gwynne–Pfeffer–Sun, *Weak LQG metrics and Liouville first passage
percolation*, arXiv:1905.00380), Definition 3.7 (`def-around-annulus`, tex lines 1655–1657):
"for a set `A ⊂ ℂ` with the topology of an annulus, the `D_h`-distance around `A` is the infimum
of the `D_h`-lengths of the paths in `A` which disconnect the inner and outer boundaries of `A`."

We formalize "`X` disconnects `E` from `F`" in the form the proofs use: every path in `ℂ` from
a point of `E` to a point of `F` meets `X` (`Disconnects`). The inner and outer boundaries are
passed explicitly (for `𝔸_{r,R}(z)`: `sphere z r` and `sphere z R`).

Basic facts used throughout DFGPS/GM:
* `Disconnects.symm`, `Disconnects.mono`;
* a circle `∂B_ρ(z)`, `r ≤ ρ ≤ R`, disconnects `closedBall z r` from `(ball z R)ᶜ`
  (`disconnects_sphere`; intermediate value theorem);
* a set disconnecting `∂B_r(z)` from `∂B_R(z)` disconnects `closedBall z r` from `(ball z R)ᶜ`
  (`Disconnects.closedBall_compl_ball`: every path from inside to outside has a sub-path from the
  inner to the outer circle, again by the intermediate value theorem).
These two are own elementary arguments (the papers use them without comment).
