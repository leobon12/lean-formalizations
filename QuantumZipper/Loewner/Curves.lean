# Simple curves, chords, and their complementary components

Definitions of what it means for a hull-generating curve to be a simple arc in `ℍ` from a
real starting point (the case `κ < 4` of the reverse flow's hull, Sheffield §1.2–1.3), of a
chordal simple curve from `0` to `∞` in `ℍ` (the SLE trace itself), of the two complementary
components of `ℍ` cut off by such a chord, and of the normalized conformal uniformizer of a
component onto `ℍ`. See `FOUNDATIONS.md` §4.

Only the definitions are given here; the ODE-driven facts (that `revHull W T` is such a hull
when `κ < 4`, that the trace is such a chord, existence of the uniformizer via Riemann mapping
+ Carathéodory) are separate, later tasks.

/-- `K` is the hull of a simple curve in `ℍ` started from a real point: there is a curve
`γ : [0,1] → ℂ`, continuous and injective on `[0,1]`, with `γ 0` real and `γ t ∈ ℍ` for all
`t ∈ (0,1]`, whose image on `(0,1]` is exactly `K`. This is the shape of `revHull W T` in the
paper's setting `κ < 4` (Sheffield §1.2), where the reverse flow's hull is cut off by a simple
arc from a boundary point. -/

/-- `η` is a chordal simple curve from `0` to `∞` in `ℍ`: it starts at `0`, is continuous and
injective on `[0,∞)`, lies in `ℍ` for all positive times, and its norm tends to infinity. This
is the shape of the SLE trace `trace (drive κ B ω)` in the paper's setting `κ < 8`, where the
trace is a.s. a simple curve (Sheffield §1, Theorem 1.3 and its converse). -/

/-- The left complementary component of a chord `η`: the points of `ℍ \ η '' [0,∞)` that can
be joined, inside `ℍ \ η '' [0,∞)`, to some negative real point by a path whose only possible
escape from that set is at its own endpoint. For a simple chord `η`, this is one of the two
components `D₁, D₂` of `ℍ \ η` (Sheffield §1.2–1.3), namely the one adjacent to `(-∞,0)`. -/

/-- The right complementary component of a chord `η`: the points of `ℍ \ η '' [0,∞)` that can
be joined, inside `ℍ \ η '' [0,∞)`, to some positive real point by a path whose only possible
escape from that set is at its own endpoint. For a simple chord `η`, this is the other of the
two components `D₁, D₂` of `ℍ \ η` (Sheffield §1.2–1.3), the one adjacent to `(0,∞)`. -/

/-- `φ` is the normalized conformal uniformizer of `D` onto `ℍ`: a conformal (holomorphic and
bijective) bijection `D → ℍ` sending the marked boundary point `0` to `0` and `∞` to `∞`. In
the paper's setting `D` is one of the two components `D₁, D₂` cut off by the SLE trace, and
`φ` is unique up to `z ↦ a z` for `a > 0` (existence needs the Riemann mapping theorem plus
Carathéodory's extension theorem, a blueprint item). -/
