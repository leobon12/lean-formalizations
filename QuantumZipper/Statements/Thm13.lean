# Theorem 1.3 (conformal welding: quantum lengths agree)

Sheffield, *Conformal weldings of random surfaces*, Theorem 1.3. Specification only.

Setting (`κ ∈ (0,4)`, `γ = √κ`, `T > 0`): `B` is a standard Brownian motion, `f_T` the reverse
centered Loewner map driven by `W = √κ B` (`revMap W T`), `h̃` an independent free-boundary
GFF on `ℍ` (modulo additive constants), and
`h = 𝔥_T + h̃∘f_T`, where `𝔥_T(z) = (2/√κ) log|f_T(z)| + Q log|f_T'(z)|`, `Q = 2/γ + γ/2`.
The coordinate change of the GFF part carries no `Q`-term (it sits in `𝔥_T`), FOUNDATIONS §8.

Conclusion (STATEMENT_SPEC A10): almost surely, (i) every non-tip point `z` of `η_T` (the hull
`revHull W T`; the tip is `f_T(0) = revMapBdry W T 0`) has preimages `x₋ < 0 < x₊` under the
boundary extension of `f_T`, and (ii) whenever `x₋ < 0 < x₊` are identified by the boundary
extension at a point of `η_T` or at the base point `0` (DECISIONS D9), the quantum lengths
agree: `ν_h[x₋,0] = ν_h[0,x₊]`, and (iii) `ν_h` charges every nonempty open interval
(DECISIONS D13, excluding the junk measure).

/-- The field of the reverse coupling (Theorem 1.2/1.3) for a deterministic driving function
`W` and a free-field sample `x`: `h = 𝔥_T + x∘f_T` with
`𝔥_T(z) = (2/√κ) log|f_T(z)| + Q log|f_T'(z)|`, `Q = Qc (√κ)`, and `f_T = revMap W T`.
The coordinate change of `x` carries no `Q`-term. (Local copy of the field of
`Statements/CouplingFields.lean`, kept independent on purpose.) -/

/-- **Theorem 1.3.** For `κ ∈ (0,4)`, `T > 0`, a Brownian motion `B` and an independent
free-boundary GFF `X` (modulo additive constants), let `W = √κ B`, `h = 𝔥_T + X∘f_T`, and
`ν = ν_h` the `√κ`-LQG boundary measure. Almost surely:
1. every point `z` of `η_T = revHull W T` other than the tip `revMapBdry W T 0 = f_T(0)` is the
   image under the boundary extension of `f_T` of some `x₋ < 0` and some `x₊ > 0`;
2. for all `x₋ < 0 < x₊` with `f_T(x₋) = f_T(x₊) ∈ η_T`, `ν[x₋,0] = ν[0,x₊]`.
   The base pair `(0₋, 0₊)` (preimages of `η(0) = 0`) is included, hence `insert 0`
   (DECISIONS D9).
3. `ν` charges every nonempty open interval (DECISIONS D13): this non-degeneracy conjunct
   excludes the junk value `qBoundaryMeasure = 0`, for which clause 2 would hold trivially.

The additive constant of the free field is arbitrary: `IsFreeGFFModConstH` allows any
convention (even a random one), matching the paper's remark that the conclusion is invariant
under `ν_h ↦ c ν_h`. -/
