# The capacity zipper and length unzipping

`Z^LEN_ℓ`, `ℓ ≥ 0`, is in `Zipper/LengthZip.lean`.

`FOUNDATIONS.md` §7, `STATEMENT_SPEC.md` A8, A12, A13, `THEOREM_STATEMENTS_ENGLISH.md`
Corollary 1.5 and Theorem 1.8.

A configuration is a pair `c = (x, W) : FieldSample × (ℝ → ℝ)`: the field `h` on `ℍ` and the
driving function `W` of the curve `η` from `0` to `∞`. It encodes the pair of quantum surfaces
`((D₁,h|D₁),(D₂,h|D₂))` cut out by `η` (A8). Only the values of `W` on `[0,∞)` are meaningful.
All driving functions *produced* here are normalized to vanish on `(−∞,0]`, matching the
convention of `drive` (`SLE/Defs.lean`), so that laws of configurations can be compared as laws
of `ℝ → ℝ`-valued maps.

## Sign verification (reverse flow vs. forward flow)

The flows of `Loewner/Forward.lean` and `Loewner/Reverse.lean` are, in differential form,
`∂ₜ fₜ = 2/fₜ − Ẇₜ` (forward, `fₜ = gₜ − Wₜ`) and `∂ₜ uₜ = −2/uₜ − Ẇₜ` (reverse), with
`f₀ = u₀ = z` when `W 0 = 0`.

1. *Reverse map = inverse of a centered forward map.* Let `V` be a driver with `V 0 = 0`, `gᵣ`
   its uncentered forward maps, fix `t`, `w ∈ ℍ`, `z₀ := g_t⁻¹(w + V t)`, `Gᵣ := gᵣ(z₀)`, and
   `u s := G (t−s) − V (t−s)` for `s ∈ [0,t]`. Then `u 0 = w` and
   `u' s = −2/(G(t−s) − V(t−s)) − d/ds V(t−s) = −2/u s − U' s` with `U s := V(t−s) − V t`
   (normalized by `U 0 = 0`). Hence `revMap U t w = u t = z₀ = (fwdMap V t)⁻¹ w`: the reverse
   map driven by `U` at time `t` inverts the centered forward map driven by `V`. Conversely,
   given `W'`, the choice `V r := W'(t−r) − W' t` gives `V(t−s) − V t = W' s`, so
   `revMap W' t = (fwdMap V t)⁻¹` and `K_t = revHull W' t` is the forward hull of `V` at time
   `t`: the zipped segment is traced from `0` by the time-reversed driver `V`.
2. *Continuing with the image of `η`.* After zipping, the new curve is `K_t ∪ f(η)` with
   `f := revMap W' t`. Uniformize `ℍ \ (K_t ∪ f(η[0,r]))` by `ζ ↦ gᵣ^η(g_t^V(ζ) − V t)`; the
   half-plane capacities add (`2t + 2r`), so the uncentered Loewner map at time `t + r` is
   `ζ ↦ gᵣ^η(g_t^V(ζ) − V t) + V t`, and its driver (the image of the tip `f(η(r))`) is
   `gᵣ^η(η(r)) + V t = W r + V t = W r − W' t`. So for `s ≥ t` the new driver is
   `W (s − t) − W' t`; it is continuous at `s = t` (both sides equal `−W' t`) and `0` at `0`.
3. *Unzipping.* The remaining curve `f_t^η(η[t,∞))` is uniformized by
   `ζ ↦ g_{t+s}((g_t)⁻¹(ζ + W t)) − W t = ζ + 2s/ζ + …`, with driver `W (t+s) − W t`.
4. *Brownian rescaling.* `rescale x Q a = x(a·) + Q log a`, so a point `w` of the old picture
   is `w / a` in the new one: the new curve is (old remaining curve)`/a`. Since
   `hcap(K/a) = hcap(K)/a²`, `g^{η/a}_s(ζ) = g^η_{a²s}(aζ)/a`, with driver `W(a² s)/a`.
