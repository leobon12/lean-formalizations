# Chordal SLE: the driving function, and the random Loewner objects it drives

Chordal SLE_κ in `ℍ` from `0` to `∞` (Sheffield §1, following Schramm) is the random family
of centered forward/reverse Loewner flows of `QuantumZipper.Loewner.Forward` and
`QuantumZipper.Loewner.Reverse`, driven by the random function `W_t = √κ B_t`, where
`B` is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion. This file packages that driving function
and the resulting trace, hulls, and maps as functions of `(κ, B, ω)`. See `FOUNDATIONS.md` §4.

Only the definitions are given here; that `B` is a.s. Brownian, and the probabilistic
properties of the resulting objects, are separate tasks.
