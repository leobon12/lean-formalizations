# W6g: gluing an independent drift Brownian motion at a stopping time

Converse form of the strong Markov property, the tool that node W6 of
`blueprint/EXT_PP_BLUEPRINT.md` (§A.1) needs: "the converse form is also needed (for W6):
gluing an independent BM at `T` gives a drift BM in law".

For `Y = dpath σ μ b` a drift-`μ` Brownian motion started at `0` with continuous paths, `T` a
finite stopping time of the natural filtration of `b`, and `Y' = dpath σ μ b'` an independent
copy of `Y`, the *glued* path

`Z_t = Y_t` for `t ≤ T`, `Z_t = Y_T + Y'_{t - T}` for `t > T`

(`map_glue_eq`) has the law of `Y`. This is the converse form of the strong Markov property
("glueing"): at a stopping time the motion may be restarted with the increments of an
independent copy. Source: Revuz–Yor, *Continuous Martingales and Brownian Motion*, 3rd ed.,
III §3 (Markov property) and VII §3 (strong Markov property at a stopping time); Karatzas–Shreve,
*Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus*, Thm 2.6.16 (the restarted motion `B_{T+·} - B_T` is a
Brownian motion independent of `𝓕_T`, from which the glueing statement follows at once). The
drift case adds no difficulty (the drift is a deterministic function of time).

Route (the blueprint's, W1 converse form). Write the glued path as `glueC (past) (fut)` where
`past = (Y_{·∧T}, T)` is the stopped past and `fut = Y'` is the future. The pair `(past, fut)`
and the pair `(past, sm)` with `sm = Y_{T+·} - Y_T` the restarted path of `Y` have the *same
law*: on both sides the pair law is the product of the marginal laws, because `past` is
`𝓕_T`-measurable, `fut` is a function of `b'` (independent of the whole path of `b`), and `sm`
is independent of `𝓕_T` (`StrongMarkov.indep_smPath`); and `law fut = law sm = law Y`
(`StrongMarkov.map_restrict_smPath_eq` and `map_path_eq_of_isPreBrownianReal`). Pushing the two
equal joint laws forward by the glue functional gives `law Z = law (reconstruction)`, and the
reconstruction is `Y` pathwise since `Y_T + (Y_{T+u} - Y_T) = Y_{T+u}`.

The one technical point is the measurability of the glue functional: it evaluates a path at the
random time `T`, and evaluation at a random index is *not* jointly measurable on the full path
space. We therefore carry the paths as elements of the subtype of *continuous* paths, on which
evaluation is jointly measurable (`measurable_uncurry_of_continuous_of_measurable`, continuity
in the time variable). This is the "measurable surrogate" device of blueprint W0(d), realized
here by the subtype instead of a junk value.

Sources: Karatzas–Shreve, *Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus*, 2nd ed., Thm 2.6.16
(glueing); Revuz–Yor III §3, VII §3 (strong Markov property); the finite-dimensional/projective
step is not needed here. Own formalization of the pairing argument (own elementary proof, in the
style of `lintegral_pair_eq` in `Markov.lean`).
