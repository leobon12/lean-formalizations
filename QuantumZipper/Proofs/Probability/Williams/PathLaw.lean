# W7: path laws from finite-dimensional laws, and de-integration

Node W7 of `blueprint/EXT_PP_BLUEPRINT.md` (§A.1), together with the de-integration lemma of
W5(ii). Both are steps of the proof of `WilliamsDriftDecomposition` (L14).

## Path laws from finite-dimensional laws

`map_eq_of_forall_finset`: if `P` on `Ω` and `P'` on `Ω'` are finite measures and
`X : Ω → (ℝ≥0 → ℝ)`, `X' : Ω' → (ℝ≥0 → ℝ)` are a.e. measurable path-valued maps, then
`P.map X = P'.map X'` on `ℝ≥0 → ℝ` as soon as all finite-dimensional restrictions have equal
laws. This is the assertion used to finish W6: equality of the finite-dimensional laws of
`Z_c` and `Ŷ` implies equality of the path laws. It generalizes `WedgeRes.map_path_eq` (which is
the case of pre-Brownian motions, using the known projective family of `BrownianReal`) to
arbitrary two-space pairs.

Source: Kolmogorov extension uniqueness, in the form available in mathlib —
`ProbabilityTheory.isProjectiveLimit_map`
(`Mathlib/Probability/Process/FiniteDimensionalLaws.lean`; the law of a process is the projective
limit of its finite-dimensional distributions) together with
`MeasureTheory.IsProjectiveLimit.unique`
(`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Constructions/Projective.lean`: the projective limit of a family of
*finite* measures is unique). The one-space version is
`ProbabilityTheory.map_eq_iff_forall_finset_map_restrict_eq`. Nothing here is original.

## De-integration

`eqOn_of_setIntegral_Ioc_eq`: a function `f : ℝ → ℝ` that is right-continuous at every `x ≥ 0`
(continuity within `[x, ∞)`) is determined on `[0, ∞)` by the values `∫_{(r,r']} f` of its
integrals over the intervals `(r, r'] ⊆ [0, ∞)`. This is W5(ii): the killed finite-dimensional
identities of W5(i) are equal for `p = Ŷ` and for the reversed path over every `(r, r']`, and the
integrands (which are right-continuous for continuous `g`) are recovered by de-integration.

Source: `blueprint/EXT_PP_BLUEPRINT.md` §A.1 W5(ii). Own elementary proof (the blueprint gives no
argument): right continuity of `f` and `g` at `x` makes `f - g` strictly positive on a
right-neighbourhood `(x, x + ε]`, and an integrable function that is strictly positive on an
interval of positive measure has positive integral there, contradicting the vanishing of
`∫_{(r,r']} (f - g)`.

/-- **W7.** Two finite measures on two spaces, carrying path-valued maps `X`, `X'` into
`ℝ≥0 → ℝ`, have the same path law as soon as every finite-dimensional restriction has the same
law. (`I.restrict (X ω)` is the function `i ↦ X ω i` on the finite set `I`.) -/
