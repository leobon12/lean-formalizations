# W5 (part 2): the density of the killed occupation measure

Preparation for W5(i), reversed side, of `blueprint/EXT_PP_BLUEPRINT.md` (§A.1). The blueprint
identifies the density of the killed occupation measure of `X + c` (`X = dpath σ (-μ) b`, killed at
`T_c`) with `C · χ_c(z)`, `C = occDens σ μ 0`, via
`ν^X(· - c) - ν^X(·)` and the hitting probabilities of W3. The two ingredients proved here:

* `occDens_neg_drift`: the occupation density of `X` is the reflected one of `Y`,
  `occDens σ (-μ) x = occDens σ μ (-x)` (symmetry of the Gaussian density);
* `chiKill_toReal_mul`: for `z > 0`, `z ≠ c`, `c > 0`,
  `χ_c(z) · C = occDens σ μ (c - z) - occDens σ μ (-z)`,
  i.e. the density `occDens σ μ (c - z)` of `ν^X(· - c)` at `z` is `C χ_c(z)` plus the density
  `occDens σ μ (-z)` of `ν^X` at `z`.

Proof of the second item (blueprint sketch, W5(i)): for `z > 0`, `z ≠ c`,
`{z + Y > 0 forever, z + Y hits c at a positive time} = {Y hits c - z} \ {Y hits -z}`
(intermediate value theorem), and the hitting probabilities are `1` for positive levels
(`ae_exists_eq_level`) and `occDens σ μ y / C` for negative ones (`prob_hit_neg`, W3). The
blueprint's route through the factorization `P(τ_{-z}) = P(τ_{c-z}) P(τ_{-c})` is not needed: the
difference form above gives the case `z > c` directly (own simplification).
