# CORE_ARC, part 3d: continuity of a surjective monotone reparametrisation; tip convergence

Plan nodes "τ continuous" and "Tip convergence" of `blueprint/CORE_ARC_PLAN.md`.

## Main results

* `continuousOn_Icc_of_monotoneOn_of_surj`: a function monotone on `[0,T]` with `τ 0 = 0`,
  `τ T = 1` and `[0,1] ⊆ τ '' [0,T]` is continuous on `[0,T]`.
  Proof: extend by `x` below `0` and `1 + (x - T)` above `T`; the extension is monotone and
  surjective, hence continuous (`Monotone.continuous_of_surjective`).
* `tendsto_fwdMap_arc_tip`: if `K_r = γ(0, τ r]` for `r ∈ [0,T]`, with `τ` strictly increasing
  and `γ` injective on `[0,1]`, then `f_r (γ w) → 0` as `w ↓ τ r`, for `r ∈ (0,T)`.
  Proof: for `w ∈ (τ r, τ (r+η)]`, `γ w ∈ K_{r+η} \ K_r`, so local growth (T6,
  `norm_fwdMap_le_of_mem_diff`) gives `‖f_r (γ w)‖ ≤ 4 (osc_{[r,r+η]} A + √η)`.
