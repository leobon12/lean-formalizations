# CORE_ARC, part 3a: easy properties of the tip parameter `arcTime`

Plan node CORE of `blueprint/CORE_ARC_PLAN.md` (first part of CoreArc3; continuity of `arcTime`
and tip convergence are *not* here). Companion of `CoreArc2.lean`, which defines
`arcTime A γ r = sSup {u ∈ Ioc 0 1 | γ u ∈ fwdHull A r}` and proves
`arcTime_mem_Icc : arcTime A γ r ∈ Icc 0 1` and **CORE** (`fwdHull_eq_image_Ioc_arcTime`):
under the hypotheses

`hA : Continuous A`, `hγc : ContinuousOn γ (Icc 0 1)`, `hγi : InjOn γ (Icc 0 1)`,
`hK : fwdHull A T = γ '' Ioc 0 1`, `hr : 0 ≤ r`, `hrT : r ≤ T`

one has `fwdHull A r = γ '' Ioc 0 (arcTime A γ r)`.

## Main results (exact statements)

* `arcTime_mono` (**monotonicity in the time parameter**; no hypothesis on `A` or `γ`):
  `∀ {s r : ℝ}, s ≤ r → arcTime A γ s ≤ arcTime A γ r`.
* `arcTime_zero` (`hA : Continuous A`): `arcTime A γ 0 = 0`.
* `arcTime_eq_one_of_fwdHull_eq` (`hK : fwdHull A T = γ '' Ioc 0 1`): `arcTime A γ T = 1`.
* `fwdHull_eq_of_arcTime_eq` (CORE hypotheses, `r, r' ∈ Icc 0 T`):
  `arcTime A γ r = arcTime A γ r' → fwdHull A r = fwdHull A r'`.
* `strictMonoOn_arcTime` (`hA`, `A 0 = 0`, CORE hypotheses):
  `StrictMonoOn (arcTime A γ) (Icc 0 T)`.
* `monotoneOn_arcTime`: `MonotoneOn (arcTime A γ) (Icc 0 T)`.

## Hypotheses: what is needed and why

* `A 0 = 0` is genuinely needed in `strictMonoOn_arcTime`: it enters through
  `RS.fwdHull_ssubset`, i.e. strict growth of hulls, whose proof uses the time-reversal
  normalisation at `0` (`RS.fwdHull_nonempty_of_pos`, a Phragmén–Lindelöf argument). Without it
  the statement is not available from the library, and equal hulls at two times would not
  contradict the clock.
* `Continuous A` is needed in `arcTime_zero` only, for `RS.fwdHull_zero_eq_empty`
  (`swallowTime_pos` is proved for continuous drivers); `fwdHull A 0 = ∅` is false in general.
* Nothing below uses `0 < T`: (1) and (2) only evaluate at the endpoints of `Icc 0 T`, and
  (3) only uses `0 ≤ r ≤ T`. We therefore do not assume it.
* `hγc`, `hγi` are only needed where CORE (`fwdHull_eq_image_Ioc_arcTime`) is used; the
  injectivity is what lets us read off the hull equality from the parameter equality.

## Proofs

(4) `K_s = fwdHull A s ⊆ fwdHull A r = K_r` for `s ≤ r` (`fwdHull_mono_coreArc`), so
`I_s ⊆ I_r` for the two defining sets; `csSup_le_csSup` gives `sSup I_s ≤ sSup I_r`, and if
`I_s = ∅` both sides are `0` (`arcTime_mem_Icc`, `Real.sSup_empty`).
(1) `K_0 = ∅` (`RS.fwdHull_zero_eq_empty`), so `I_0 = ∅` and `sSup ∅ = 0`.
(2) `fwdHull A T = γ '' Ioc 0 1` says `γ u ∈ K_T` for every `u ∈ Ioc 0 1`, so `I_T = Ioc 0 1`
and `sSup (Ioc 0 1) = 1` (`csSup_le`, `le_csSup`).
(3) `arcTime` is monotone by (4). If `arcTime A γ r = arcTime A γ r'` for `r < r'` with
`r, r' ∈ Icc 0 T`, CORE gives
`K_r = γ '' Ioc 0 (arcTime A γ r) = γ '' Ioc 0 (arcTime A γ r') = K_{r'}`, so `K_{r'} ⊆ K_r`,
contradicting the second component of `RS.fwdHull_ssubset hA hA0 hr.1 hrr' : K_r ⊂ K_{r'}`
(which, by `Set.ssubset_def`, is `¬ K_{r'} ⊆ K_r`).

## Sources

Route of `blueprint/CORE_ARC_PLAN.md` (the project's own; no published proof of this direction
was found — see `handoff/CORE-2.md`). The statements and their proofs are elementary
consequences of the two imports; "own elementary proof" applies to each item (the only
substantial ingredient, `RS.fwdHull_ssubset`, is itself proved in `HullBasics.lean`).
