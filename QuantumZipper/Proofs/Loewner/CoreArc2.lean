# CORE_ARC, part 2: no floating piece, and hulls of an arc are initial subarcs

Plan nodes NF and CORE of `blueprint/CORE_ARC_PLAN.md`.

* `no_floating_piece` (NF). A forward hull `K_r` has no floating piece: there are no nonempty
  compact `Q ⊆ K_r` and open `V ⊇ Q` with `closure V` compact, `closure V ⊆ ℍ` and
  `closure V ∩ K_r ⊆ Q`.
  ```
  theorem no_floating_piece {A : ℝ → ℝ} (hA : Continuous A) {r : ℝ} (hr : 0 ≤ r)
      {Q V : Set ℂ} (hQK : Q ⊆ fwdHull A r) (hQc : IsCompact Q) (hQne : Q.Nonempty)
      (hV : IsOpen V) (hQV : Q ⊆ V) (hVc : IsCompact (closure V)) (hVH : closure V ⊆ H)
      (hVK : closure V ∩ fwdHull A r ⊆ Q) : False
  ```
* `mem_fwdHull_of_lt` (CORE, down-closure) and `fwdHull_eq_image_Ioc_arcTime` (CORE): if
  `K_T = γ(0,1]` for a curve `γ` continuous and injective on `[0,1]`, then for `r ∈ [0,T]`
  ```
  fwdHull A r = γ '' Ioc 0 (arcTime A γ r),   arcTime A γ r ∈ Icc 0 1,
  ```
  where `arcTime A γ r = sSup {u ∈ (0,1] | γ u ∈ K_r}`.

## Proof of NF (following the plan)

Let `q₀ ∈ Q` minimise the swallowing time over `Q` (it is lower semicontinuous because
`ℍ \ K_t` is open). The compact set `∂V = closure V \ V` misses `K_r`, so `Im f_s ≥ m > 0`
on `∂V` for all `s ≤ r` (T3). A swallowed point comes close to the driver (T2): there is
`s < σ(q₀)` with `|f_s q₀| < m`. By minimality `closure V ⊆ ℍ \ K_s`, where `f_s` is
holomorphic, injective with nonzero derivative, hence open (inverse function theorem). The
half disk `D = ℍ ∩ B(0,m)` is connected, meets the open set `f_s(V)` at `f_s q₀`, and
`closure f_s(V) ∩ D ⊆ f_s(closure V) ∩ D ⊆ f_s(V)` since `|f_s| ≥ m` on `∂V`. So
`D ⊆ f_s(V)`, which contradicts `Im f_s ≥ c > 0` on the compact set `closure V`.

## Proof of CORE from NF

If `v < u`, `γ u ∈ K_r`, `γ v ∉ K_r`, then `Q = K_r ∩ γ[v,1]` is a floating piece, with
`V` a small open thickening of `Q` (away from `ℝ` and from the compact `γ[0,v]`, which is
disjoint from `Q` by injectivity). So `{u ∈ (0,1] | γ u ∈ K_r}` is down-closed; it contains its
supremum because `ℍ \ K_r` is open.

## Sources

The route is the project's own (`blueprint/CORE_ARC_PLAN.md`), chosen to avoid the Jordan
curve theorem; it uses only compactness, connectedness of a half disk, and the open mapping
property of `f_s` (inverse function theorem). The classical converse statement (hulls of a
simple curve are its initial arcs) is in Lawler, *Conformally Invariant Processes in the Plane*,
§4.4, p. 86 (PDF p. 96); Lawler gives no proof of the direction proved here, so the argument
is the plan's own.
