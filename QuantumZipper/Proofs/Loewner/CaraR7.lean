# EXT-CA node R7: the tip of the arc is `F 0`

Blueprint `blueprint/EXT_CA_BLUEPRINT.md`, §3.R, node **R7**. For a simple reverse hull
`revHull W T = γ (0,1]` and its boundary extension `F` (`RevExt`), the tip `γ 1` is the value
of `F` at the driving point `W 0 = 0`.

Proof (the blueprint's own argument, via CORE's `LoewnerSubhullsOfArc`): the tip is attained at
some real `m` (`RevExt.surj`). If `m ≠ 0`, `m` is not swallowed by some small time `s ∈ (0,T)`,
so by R4 (`eq_comp_of_extension`) `F m` is the value at a real point of the extension `F'` of the
shifted map `revMap W⁺ (T - s)`, which lies in `ℝ ∪ closure (revHull W⁺ (T - s))`. But
`revHull W⁺ (T - s) = γ (0, τ (T - s)]` with `τ (T - s) < 1` (`revHull_shift_eq`,
`LoewnerSubhullsOfArc`), whose closure misses the tip `γ 1` by injectivity. The flow of real
points follows G. Lawler, *Conformally Invariant Processes in the Plane* (AMS 2005), §4.1, p. 80.
