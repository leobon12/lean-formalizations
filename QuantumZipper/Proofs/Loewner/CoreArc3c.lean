# CORE_ARC, part 3c: no jumps (the analytic core of left continuity of `arcTime`)

Plan node "No jump (left continuity)" of `blueprint/CORE_ARC_PLAN.md`.

## Main result

* `no_jump`: let `A` be continuous with `A 0 = 0`, `0 < s`, `closedBall p R ⊆ ℍ` disjoint from
  every `K_{s'}`, `s' ∈ [0,s)`, with `p` an accumulation point of `K_s` and a point
  `q ∈ ball p R \ K_s`. Then `False`.

## Proof

`g := 0` on `K_s` and `g := f_s` off `K_s`. Along `σ n = s - s/(n+2) ↑ s`, `f_{σ n} → g`
pointwise on the closed disc (`tendsto_fwdMap_nhdsLT_of_mem`, `tendsto_fwdMap_nhdsLT_of_notMem`),
and `‖f_{σ n}‖ ≤ C` there (UB, `norm_fwdMap_sub_le_uniform`). Each `f_{σ n}` is holomorphic on
the closed disc, so it is given by its Cauchy integral; dominated convergence passes this to
`g`, so `g` equals the Cauchy integral of `g` on the open disc and is analytic there
(`hasFPowerSeriesOn_cauchy_integral`). It vanishes on `K_s`, which accumulates at `p`, so it
vanishes on the disc (identity theorem), but `g q = f_s q ∈ ℍ`.

## Sources

Route of `blueprint/CORE_ARC_PLAN.md`, the project's own: no published proof of this direction
(Loewner hulls of an arc are its initial subarcs, with continuous parametrisation) in this
form was found (see `handoff/CORE-2.md`). The analytic tools are standard mathlib results (Cauchy
integral formula, power series of Cauchy integrals, dominated convergence, identity theorem).
Own elementary proof of the assembly (a Vitali-type limit argument).

/-- **No jump.** A closed disc in `ℍ` that is disjoint from every `K_{s'}`, `s' < s`, cannot
meet `K_s` in a set accumulating at its centre while also containing a point off `K_s`. -/
