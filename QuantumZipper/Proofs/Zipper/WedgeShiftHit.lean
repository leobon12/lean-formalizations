# WEDGE-SHIFT (1): a measurable first hitting time and re-centred path on path space

Input of the translation step `F1.WedgeShiftLawStmt` of B4(c) (Duplantier–Miller–Sheffield,
*Liouville quantum gravity as a mating of trees*, arXiv:1409.7055, proof of Prop. 4.7(i), p. 77:
the radial part is re-centred at the first time it hits a level; Sheffield, arXiv:1012.4797,
§1.6).

The hitting time `T(a) = inf {s ≥ 0 : a s ≤ -c}` and the re-centred path `a(T(a) + ·) + c` are
not measurable for the product σ-algebra on `ℝ → ℝ`. We build measurable functions `hitT c`,
`shiftPath c` on `ℝ → ℝ` that read `a` only through countably many values and agree with them
on **every continuous** path (`hitT_eq_of_continuous`, `shiftPath_eq_of_continuous`):

* `hitT c a = inf {t > 0 : ∀ j, ∃ q ∈ ℚ ∩ [0, t], a q < -c + 1/(j+1)}` (an up-closed set of
  positive reals, `LQGMeas.measurable_sInf_upClosed`); for continuous `a` its members are the
  `t > 0` with `min_{[0,t]} a ≤ -c`;
* `shiftPath c a t = extP a (hitT c a + t) + c` (`WedgeLaw.extP`, the dyadic read-off).

Own elementary argument.
