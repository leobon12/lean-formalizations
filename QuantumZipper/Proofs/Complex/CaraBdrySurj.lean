# EXT-CA C7 and the Jordan case of C6: boundary surjectivity, homeomorphism onto the frontier

Blueprint `blueprint/EXT_CA_BLUEPRINT.md`, §3 C6 (corollary), C7. Standing data as in
`CaraBdryFold.lean`: `CarHyp ψ D E R₀`, a continuous extension `F` of `ψ` to `Hbar`, and the
limit `wInf` of `ψ` at `∞`.

* **C7** `frontier_eq_insert_range`: `frontier D = {wInf} ∪ F(ℝ)` (compactness of
  `Hbar ∪ {∞}`, `closure_image_subset`, and C1). Pommerenke, *Boundary Behaviour of Conformal
  Maps* (1992), Thm 2.1 and the line "`f(𝔻̄) = Ḡ`, `f(𝕋) = ∂G`" used in the proofs of Prop. 2.5
  and Thm 2.6, printed pp. 20–24.
* `tendsto_extension_cocompact`: `F x → wInf` as `|x| → ∞` along `ℝ`.
* **C6, Jordan case** `isClosedEmbedding_bdryMap`: if `E \ {q}` is preconnected for every `q`,
  the boundary map `ℝ ∪ {∞} → ℂ` (`bdryMap F wInf`) is a closed embedding with range
  `frontier D`, i.e. a homeomorphism of `ℝ ∪ {∞}` onto `frontier D`. Pommerenke (1992), Thm 2.6,
  (iii) ⇒ (i), p. 24: continuous (Thm 2.1), each boundary point attained once (Prop. 2.5), and a
  continuous bijection from a compact space onto a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
