# Hurwitz's theorem (EXT-CA node A5)

Blueprint `blueprint/EXT_CA_BLUEPRINT.md`, §3.A, node **A5**.

* `hurwitz_eventually_exists_eq`: if `F n → f` locally uniformly on an open `U`, the `F n` are
  holomorphic, `f z₀ = w` and `f` is not identically `w` near `z₀`, then for every `ε > 0`
  and all large `n` the equation `F n z = w` has a solution in `U ∩ ball z₀ ε`.
* `hurwitz_eventually_exists_zero`: the version on a preconnected `U` with `f` nonconstant.
* `hurwitz_injOn`: a locally uniform limit of injective holomorphic maps on a preconnected
  open set is injective or constant.

Proof route (as prescribed by the blueprint, no argument principle): the zero of `f - w` at
`z₀` is isolated; on a small circle `‖f - w‖ ≥ m > 0`, so `‖F n - w‖ > m/2` there for large `n`
while `‖F n z₀ - w‖ < m/2`; if `F n - w` had no zero in the closed disk, the maximum modulus
principle for `1/(F n - w)` would give `‖F n z₀ - w‖ ≥ m/2`. Statement: Ahlfors, *Complex
Analysis*, 3rd ed. 1979, Ch. 5 §1.1, Theorem 2 (Hurwitz), p. 178, proved there with the
argument principle; the minimum-modulus variant used here is our own (elementary) route, as
the blueprint prescribes. (b) follows from (a) as in Ahlfors, Ch. 6 §1.1, p. 231 (univalence
of the limit in the proof of the Riemann mapping theorem): two distinct preimages of one value
would give two distinct preimages for `F n`, `n` large.
