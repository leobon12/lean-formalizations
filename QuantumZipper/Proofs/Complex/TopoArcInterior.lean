# An arc contains no disc around an interior point (EXT-CA node T4(c), CORE-3B item 2)

An arc in `ℂ` (the image of an injective continuous map on `Icc 0 1`, see `IsArcSet`) has empty
interior: it contains no disc around any of its interior points, and hence no disc at all
(`interior_arc_eq_empty`).

* `not_ball_subset_arc`: no ball around `γ c`, `0 < c < 1`, is contained in the arc `γ '' Icc 0 1`.
* `interior_arc_eq_empty`: `IsArcSet A → interior A = ∅`.

**Proof (own elementary proof; blueprint §3 T4(c): "an arc minus an interior point is
disconnected; a disk minus a point is not").** Suppose `ball (γ c) R ⊆ γ '' Icc 0 1` for an
interior parameter `c`. Choose `0 < ρ < R` also smaller than the two distances
`dist (γ 0) (γ c)`, `dist (γ 1) (γ c)` (positive by injectivity). The sphere `S := sphere (γ c) ρ`
is preconnected (`isPreconnected_sphere`, using `Module.rank ℝ ℂ = 2`) and lies in the arc. By
continuity of `γ` at `c` pick `ε > 0` with `dist (γ t) (γ c) < ρ` for `t ∈ Icc 0 1` and
`dist t c < ε`; then every point of `S` is `γ t` with `t` outside the open interval
`(c - ε, c + ε)`. So `S ⊆ K₁ ∪ K₂` for the compact (hence closed) sets
`K₁ = γ '' Icc 0 (c - ε)` and `K₂ = γ '' Icc (c + ε) 1`, which are disjoint by injectivity. But
the intermediate value theorem applied to `t ↦ dist (γ t) (γ c)` on `[0, c]` and on `[c, 1]`
(the values at `c` and at the endpoints are `0 < ρ` and `> ρ`) exhibits points of `S` in each of
`K₁`, `K₂`, contradicting the preconnectedness of `S`. For the endpoint case, a disc around
`γ 0` (or `γ 1`) contains a disc of half the radius around a nearby `γ t` with `t ∈ Ioo 0 1`,
which the previous step rules out. -/
