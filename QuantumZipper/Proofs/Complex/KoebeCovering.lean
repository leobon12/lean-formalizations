# Koebe covering and Koebe's estimate on a disk (EXT-CA nodes K3, K5a-disk; EXT-JS node D2)

For `f` injective and holomorphic on `ball c r`:

* `ball_subset_image_koebe`: `ball (f c) (r ‖f'(c)‖ / 48) ⊆ f '' ball c r` (Koebe covering with
  the non-sharp constant `koebeCovConst = 1/48` instead of `1/4`);
* `image_ball_ne_univ`: `f '' ball c r ≠ univ`;
* `koebeCovConst_mul_le_infDist` and `infDist_le_mul_norm_deriv`: Koebe's estimate
  `r ‖f'(c)‖ / 48 ≤ dist (f c, ∂ f(B)) ≤ r ‖f'(c)‖`.

## Sources and deviations

Statement: Koebe's estimate, Garnett–Marshall, *Harmonic Measure* (CUP 2005), Ch. I,
Theorem 4.3, eq. (4.13), p. 19 (the disk `ball c r` is the unit disk after the affine change
`z ↦ c + r z`, evaluated at the center); Pommerenke, *Boundary Behaviour of Conformal Maps*
(1992), Cor. 1.4. Koebe [1907] himself proved the left inequality with some constant `≤ 1/4`
(Garnett–Marshall, Notes to Ch. I, p. 26); `1/4` is Bieberbach's.

* The right inequality follows Garnett–Marshall's proof of Thm 4.3 (Schwarz lemma for the inverse
  map), see `radius_mul_norm_deriv_le_of_ball_subset_image`.
* The left inequality follows Burckel, *Classical Analysis in the Complex Plane* (Birkhäuser
  2021), Theorem 7.27 (step (4)), Corollary 7.28 and the remark after it ("latent in the proof
  of 7.27 is a lower bound of 1/24"), pp. 481–483 (PDF pp. 506–508): with `w₀` a nearest
  omitted point and `G = √(f − w₀)`, the sets `G(B)` and `−G(B)` are disjoint, `G(B)` contains a
  disk around `G c` of radius comparable to `|G c|`, and the Schwarz lemma (Burckel 6.1) applied
  to `1/(G + G c)` bounds `|f'(c)|`. We take the disk of radius `|G c|/3` (Burckel: `(√2 − 1)|G c|`)
  and the Schwarz lemma with target radius `2`, which gives `1/48` instead of Burckel's `1/24`.
  The area-theorem proofs of the sharp `1/4` (Garnett–Marshall Thm I.4.1, Pommerenke *Univalent
  Functions* Thm 1.3–1.5) need Green's formula, absent from mathlib (recorded in
  `DEVIATIONS.md`, D-KOEBE).
