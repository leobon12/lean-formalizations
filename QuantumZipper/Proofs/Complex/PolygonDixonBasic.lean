# The difference quotient of a holomorphic function (EXT-CA node H3, part 1)

Blueprint `blueprint/EXT_CA_BLUEPRINT.md`, §3 "H. Homology Cauchy", node H3 (Dixon's theorem).

This file contains the analytic core of Dixon's proof that a closed polygon whose winding number
vanishes outside a domain carries zero integral of any holomorphic function.  The function

`sec f z w = (f z - f w)/(z - w)` for `z ≠ w`,  `sec f z z = deriv f z`,

is, for `f` holomorphic on an open `U`, *jointly continuous* on `U × U`: off the diagonal this is
elementary, on the diagonal it is the strict differentiability of `f`, which for a holomorphic `f`
comes from its analyticity (`HasFPowerSeriesAt.hasStrictFDerivAt`).

## Sources

S. A. Dixon, *A brief proof of Cauchy's integral theorem*, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. **29** (1971)
625-626: the function `(z,w) ↦ (f(z) - f(w))/(z - w)` extended by `f'(z)` on the diagonal is
continuous on `U × U` (there: "strictly differentiable"), the source of the two-variable kernel of
the proof of the homology form of Cauchy's theorem.  The analyticity `DifferentiableOn ℂ f U →
AnalyticOn ℂ f U` used to obtain strict differentiability is mathlib's
`DifferentiableOn.analyticAt`, `HasFPowerSeriesAt.hasStrictFDerivAt`.

The two-variable Cauchy kernel g and the continuity statement are also in R. B. Burckel,
*Classical Analysis in the Complex Plane* (Birkhäuser 2021), Theorem 10.11 area (the homology form
of Cauchy's theorem), and in R. Narasimhan and Y. Nievergelt, *Complex Analysis in One Variable*
(2nd ed.), §5.
