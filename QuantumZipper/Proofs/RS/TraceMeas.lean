# EXT-RS node TR6: a measurable, continuous version of the SLE trace

Blueprint `blueprint/EXT_RS_BLUEPRINT.md` §3, node **TR6** (task RS-TR6-NR).

## Main results (namespace `QuantumZipper.RS`)

* `tendsto_fwdMapInv_of_rpow_bound`: a bound `‖f̂_t(iy) − p‖ ≤ C y^δ` on `y ∈ (0,1]` gives
  `f̂_t(iy) → p` as `y ↓ 0`.
* `measurable_fwdMapInv_drive`: for a measurable Brownian path version with continuous paths and
  `B 0 = 0` everywhere, `ω ↦ f̂_t(w)` is measurable (P3(e) `fwdMapInv_drive_eq_revMap_revBM`
  plus `ReverseFlow.measurable_revMap_drive`).
* `exists_measurable_sleTrace` (**TR6**): for `0 < κ < 8` there is `η̃ : Ω → ℝ → ℂ`, jointly
  measurable in `(ω, t)` (hence also measurable into the product σ-algebra), continuous in `t`
  for every `ω`, with `η̃ ω = sleTrace κ B ω` on `[0,∞)` almost surely.

## Proof

Replace `B` by a version `B''` that is measurable, continuous with `B'' 0 = 0` for every `ω`
(`CharFun.exists_good_version`), which has the same drive a.s. Apply TR4
(`ae_sleTrace_good`) to `B''` and let `G` be a measurable full-measure set of good `ω`
(complement of `toMeasurable` of the bad set). On `G`, `η̃ ω t = sleTrace κ B'' ω (max t 0)` is
the pointwise limit of `f̂_{max t 0}(i/(n+1))`, which is continuous in `t` and measurable in `ω`,
hence jointly measurable (`measurable_uncurry_of_continuous_of_measurable`); off `G`, `η̃ = 0`.

(the trace as a uniform limit of `f̂_t(iy)`); Rohde–Schramm, *Basic properties of SLE*,
Thm 5.1 (p. 20). The measurable-version bookkeeping is an own elementary argument.
