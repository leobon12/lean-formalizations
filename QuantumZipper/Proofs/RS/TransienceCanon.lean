# EXT-RS node TRANS, tool: the canonical space of continuous paths

Blueprint `blueprint/EXT_RS_BLUEPRINT.md` §4, node **TRANS** (scaling and Markov steps).

`CPath` is the space of continuous paths `ℝ≥0 → ℝ` with the subspace σ-algebra of the product
σ-algebra, and `canonBM t f = f t` its coordinate process. Every path of `canonBM` is continuous,
so the measurable-trace machinery (TR6) applies to it directly.

* `isBrownianReal_canonBM`: the push-forward of a pre-Brownian motion with measurable
  coordinates and continuous paths makes `canonBM` a Brownian motion;
* `map_toCPath_eq`: two such pre-Brownian motions (on possibly different spaces) have the same
  law on `CPath` (Kolmogorov uniqueness, `Williams.map_eq_of_forall_finset`, and the fact that the
  σ-algebra of a subtype is the comap of the inclusion, `Williams.map_subtype_val_injective`);
* `exists_good_version0`: a Brownian motion has a version with measurable coordinates, all paths
  continuous and started at `0`; it has the same SLE trace almost surely.

Own elementary bookkeeping (measure theory only); no literature statement is involved.
