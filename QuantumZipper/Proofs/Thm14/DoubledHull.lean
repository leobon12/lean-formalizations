# The doubled SLE hull has empty interior

Node F1 of `blueprint/EXT_JS_BLUEPRINT.md`. An arc in the plane has empty interior (standard;
cf. M. H. A. Newman, *Elements of the Topology of Plane Sets of Points*, Ch. V: no arc separates
the plane, in particular a point does not separate a disk). We use the following elementary
argument (our own write-up of the standard fact, no separate source formalized): if the arc
`γ '' [a,b]` contained a disk around an interior point `p = γ t₀`, a small circle around `p`
would be a connected set covered by the two closed subarcs `γ '' [a,t₀]`, `γ '' [t₀,b]`, meeting
both (intermediate value theorem) but not their intersection `{p}`.
