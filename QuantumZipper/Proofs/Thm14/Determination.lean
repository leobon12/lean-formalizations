# Theorem 1.4(b): the measurable-selection step

Sheffield, *Conformal weldings of random surfaces*, Theorem 1.4(b) ("`h` determines `η_T`").

This file proves the measure-theoretic half of Theorem 1.4(b):

* `exists_measurable_of_partialGraph` (Lusin–Souslin): a Borel partial graph `G ⊆ S × E` of
  standard Borel spaces is contained in the graph of a measurable map `S → E`;
* `measurable_recoverDrive`, `recoverDrive_sampleDrive`: a continuous driver on `[0,T]` is
  recovered measurably from its values at (clamped) rational times;
* `theorem1_4b_of_weldingDeterminationGraph`: Theorem 1.4(b) follows from
  `WeldingDeterminationGraph`, i.e. from the existence (in every setup) of a countable family
  `ρ` of mass-zero test functions and a Borel partial graph in (pairings with `ρ`) × (driver at
  rational times) that almost surely contains the pair `((⟨h, ρ n⟩)_n, W|ℚ)`.

Theorem 1.4(b) exposes `h` only through its pairings with mass-zero test functions (the
distribution modulo additive constants, audit AUDIT-1 §2). The space `TestFun0 H → ℝ` is not
standard Borel, so Lusin–Souslin is applied to a countable subfamily of pairings. This loses
nothing, because `R_h` is a.s. a measurable function of countably many pairings.

`WeldingDeterminationGraph` is not a consequence of `theorem1_4a` alone (see the report of
task THM14B): one also needs that the true driver satisfies the hypotheses of 1.4(a) (Theorem
1.3), that `h` determines `0₋`, that the hull determines the driver, and Borel measurability of
the welding relation.
