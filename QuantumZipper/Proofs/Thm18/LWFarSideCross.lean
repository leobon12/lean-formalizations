# Theorem 1.8, node LWF-5 (side bound): a planar crossing lemma

`lwfSide_crossing`: a path `σ` in the closed upper half-plane from a negative real `u₁` to a
positive real `u₂`, and a path `τ` in the open upper half-plane from a point `p` closer to `0`
than all of `σ` to a point `q` farther from `0` than all of `σ`, must meet.

This is the topological core of the separation step "a crosscut from `(−∞,0)` to `(0,∞)`
separates `0` from `∞` in `ℍ`" used for LW eq. (2) (G. Lawler, B. Werness, *Multi-point Green's
functions for SLE and an estimate of Beffara*, Ann. Probab. 41 (2013), p. 6) and Beffara,
*The dimension of the SLE curves*, Lemma 6 (p. 13).

**Proof (own elementary argument via winding numbers**; the index of a loop is Burckel,
*Classical Analysis in the Complex Plane* (2021), Def. 4.2 / Cor. 4.3, p. 189, implemented in
`CA.Topo.loopDeg`). If the paths do not meet, the loop `Γ = σ · (conj ∘ σ)⁻¹` avoids every point of
the segment `[0, p]` and of `τ`, so its index about `0`, `p` and `q` agree (homotopy invariance,
`loopDeg_homotopy`). About `q` it is `0` (Rouché, `loopDeg_eq_of_norm_sub_lt`). About `0` it is
`−1`: `log ∘ σ` followed by `conj ∘ log ∘ σ` reversed is a continuous logarithm of `Γ` whose
increment is `conj (log u₁) − log u₁ = −2πi`.
