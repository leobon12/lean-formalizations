# Uniqueness of vague limits on an open subset of `ℂ`

Two vague limits (in the sense of `IsVagueLimitOn U`) of the same sequence agree. Proof: pull
both limits back to the subtype `↥U` (locally compact, second countable), where they are finite
on compacts hence regular, and apply `Measure.ext_of_integral_eq_on_compactlySupported`,
extending test functions on `↥U` by zero.
