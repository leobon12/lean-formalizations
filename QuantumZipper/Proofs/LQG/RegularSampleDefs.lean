# Regular field samples (blueprint `M4_BLUEPRINT.md`, §0 and node M4-R4)

A field sample `x` is *regular* when its folded-circle averages at **every** centre
`w ∈ Hbar` and **every** radius `r > 0` are given by one function `F`, continuous on
`Hbar × (0,∞)`, in the following sense:

* (i) at dyadic radii `2^{-k}`, the raw values `x (foldedCircle (dyadicRoundC n z) 2^{-k})`
  converge to `F (z, 2^{-k})` (so `avgReg x k z = F (z, 2^{-k})`) for every `z ∈ Hbar`;
* (ii) the smoothed values `∫ F(u, ρ) d(foldedCircle w r)(u)` converge to `F (w, r)` as
  `ρ → 0⁺`, locally uniformly in `(w, r) ∈ Hbar × (0,∞)`.

Clause (i) is stated with convergence (not just with the value of `avgReg`, which is a
`limUnder` and would be junk without convergence), so that regularity is stable under the
deterministic operations of node M4-R4. Consequence (proved in `RegularClosure`):
`evalReg x (foldedCircle w r) = F (w, r)` for every `w ∈ Hbar`, `r > 0`.
