# Quantum surfaces and convergence in law

`FOUNDATIONS.md` §5. `scaleParam`/`canonical` implement the rescaling (1.8) that normalizes a
field sample to have unit quantum area in `B₁(0)`. `AreaConvergesInLaw` is Proposition 1.6's
convergence in law of the (doubly-marked) canonical area measures, phrased through
finite-dimensional distributions against continuous compactly supported test functions
(Kallenberg's criterion for weak convergence of random measures on bounded subsets of `ℍ`).

/-- Convergence in law of doubly-marked quantum surfaces (Proposition 1.6): the canonical area
measures `qAreaMeasure γ (Y c ω)` converge to `qAreaMeasure γ (Y' ω)` in the sense of weak
convergence of random measures on bounded subsets of `ℍ`, expressed through finite-dimensional
distributions (Kallenberg): for every finite family of continuous, compactly supported test
functions `f j : ℂ → ℝ`, the joint law of `(∫ f j d(qAreaMeasure γ (Y c ω)))_j` under `P`
converges, as `c → ∞`, to the corresponding joint law under `P'` for `Y'`, tested against every
bounded continuous functional `F`. -/
