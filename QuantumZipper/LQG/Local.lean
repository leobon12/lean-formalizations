# Local LQG measures for fields constrained only on a subdomain

`STATEMENT_SPEC.md` A17, `blueprint/M4_BLUEPRINT.md` §D3. For fields constrained only on a
subdomain (Proposition 1.6's mixed GFF on a bounded domain `D`), the raw values of the sample on
measures far from `D` are arbitrary, so the global vague limits defining `qBoundaryMeasure` /
`qAreaMeasure` may fail to exist and those measures may be junk. The local variants here take
the vague limit of the same approximating measures `bdryApprox` / `areaApprox`, but test only
against continuous functions with compact support inside a given open set (`I ⊆ ℝ`,
resp. `U ⊆ ℂ`), so they only read the sample near that set.

These are *additions*: the global definitions of `LQG/Measures.lean` and `LQG/Surfaces.lean`
are unchanged. For globally good samples the local measures are the restrictions of the global
ones (blueprint M4-R5(d)).

/-- Vague convergence on the open set `I ⊆ ℝ`, for fields constrained only on a subdomain
(A17): the limit `ν` is concentrated on `I`, finite on compact subsets of `I`, and the integrals
of every continuous test function with compact support inside `I` converge. This is the
real-line analogue of `IsVagueLimitOn`. -/

/-- The quantum boundary length measure of `x` on the open set `I ⊆ ℝ`, for fields constrained
only on a subdomain (A17): a chosen vague limit of `bdryApprox γ x` on `I` (tested only against
continuous functions with compact support in `I`), or the junk measure `0` if none exists. -/

subdomain (A17): a chosen vague limit of `areaApprox γ x` on `U` (tested only against continuous
functions with compact support in `U`), or the junk measure `0` if none exists. -/

/-- Local analogue of `scaleParam`, for fields constrained only on a subdomain (A17): the
smallest radius `a` at which the local quantum area measure on `U` gives `B_a(0) ∩ ℍ` mass at
least `1`. -/
def scaleParamOn (γ : ℝ) (x : FieldSample) (U : Set ℂ) : ℝ :=
  sInf {a : ℝ | 0 < a ∧ 1 ≤ qAreaMeasureOn γ x U (Metric.ball 0 a ∩ H)}

/-- Local analogue of `canonical`, for fields constrained only on a subdomain (A17): rescale by
(1.8) with `scaleParamOn γ x U`, so that `B₁(0)` carries unit local quantum area. The rescaled
field lives on `canonicalDomainOn γ x U`. -/
def canonicalOn (γ : ℝ) (x : FieldSample) (U : Set ℂ) : FieldSample :=
  rescale x (Qc γ) (scaleParamOn γ x U)

/-- The domain of `canonicalOn γ x U`: `rescale x Q a` is `x(a ·) + Q log a`, so a field living
on `U` becomes a field living on `a⁻¹ U = {z | a z ∈ U}`. -/

  (fun z => (scaleParamOn γ x U : ℂ) * z) ⁻¹' U

/-- Local analogue of `AreaConvergesInLaw`, for fields constrained only on a subdomain (A17):
the area measure of `Y c ω` is the local measure `qAreaMeasureOn γ (Y c ω) (U c ω)` on the
(possibly random, `c`-dependent) open set `U c ω` where `Y c ω` lives, while the limit object
`Y'` (a field on all of `ℍ`) uses the global `qAreaMeasure`. Convergence is in the sense of
finite-dimensional distributions against continuous compactly supported test functions
(Kallenberg), exactly as in `AreaConvergesInLaw`. -/
