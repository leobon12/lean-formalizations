# Liouville quantum gravity measures

`FOUNDATIONS.md` §5. The boundary length measure and area measure of a `γ`-LQG surface are
vague limits of explicit approximating measures built from the regularized field `avgReg`
(Sheffield §1, formulas (1.1)/(1.2)). Since vague convergence is not otherwise present in
mathlib, `IsVagueLimitR`/`IsVagueLimitOn` spell it out directly as convergence of integrals
against continuous, compactly supported test functions, and `qBoundaryMeasure`/`qAreaMeasure`
pick out a limit by `Classical.choice` when one exists (junk `0` otherwise, Principle 4 of
`FOUNDATIONS.md` §0).

/-- Two vague limits of the same sequence of measures on `ℝ` agree: a locally finite measure on
`ℝ` is determined by its integrals against continuous, compactly supported test functions
(`MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_integral_eq_on_compactlySupported`, since every locally finite
Borel measure on the `σ`-compact metrizable space `ℝ` is automatically regular). -/

choice among vague limits, and they are all equal by `isVagueLimitR_unique`. -/
