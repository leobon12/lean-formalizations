/-- A compact set `K ⊆ ℂ` is *conformally removable* if every homeomorphism of `ℂ` that is
holomorphic off `K` is holomorphic everywhere (hence affine). -/
def IsConformallyRemovable (K : Set ℂ) : Prop :=
  IsCompact K ∧ ∀ φ : ℂ ≃ₜ ℂ, DifferentiableOn ℂ φ Kᶜ → Differentiable ℂ φ

/-- The complement `ℂ̂ \ K` of the compact set `K` in the Riemann sphere is a *Hölder domain*:
there is a conformal bijection `φ` from the exterior disk `{z | 1 < ‖z‖}` onto `Kᶜ`, conformal
at `∞` (`φ z / z → c ≠ 0` as `z → ∞`), which is uniformly Hölder on the annulus
`1 < ‖z‖ ≤ 2` (equivalently, extends Hölder-continuously to the unit circle).
This is the notion used in Jones–Smirnov, *Removability theorems for Sobolev functions and
quasiconformal maps*, Ark. Mat. 38 (2000), Corollary 2, for the domain `ℂ̂ \ K`.
We also require `K` compact, as the notion presupposes. -/
