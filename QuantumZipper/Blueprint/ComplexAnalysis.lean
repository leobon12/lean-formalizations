# Complex-analysis blueprint items for deterministic welding uniqueness

`Prop`-valued statements of standard results of geometric function theory that are used in the
proof of deterministic conformal-welding uniqueness (blueprint node A3,
`QuantumZipper.Proofs.Zipper.WeldingUniqueness`). Nothing is proved here.

/-- The welding relation on boundary points of `ℍ̄` induced by a welding homeomorphism
`φ : [a, 0] → [0, φ a]`: the two (complex) points `x, y` are the two real points `s ∈ [a, 0]`
and `φ s`, in some order. -/
def WeldingRel (a : ℝ) (φ : ℝ → ℝ) (x y : ℂ) : Prop :=
  ∃ s ∈ Icc a 0, (x = (s : ℂ) ∧ y = (φ s : ℂ)) ∨ (x = (φ s : ℂ) ∧ y = (s : ℂ))

/-- `F` is the Carathéodory boundary extension of the reverse Loewner map `revMap W T` to the
closed upper half-plane `ℍ̄ = Hbar`, with the two-sided boundary correspondence of a simple
arc from `0`:

* `F = revMap W T` on `ℍ` and `F` is continuous on `ℍ̄`;
* `F` maps `ℍ̄` onto `ℍ̄` (onto `ℍ \ K` from `ℍ`, onto `ℝ ∪ K̄` from `ℝ`);
* `F (0₋) = 0` and the welding homeomorphism sends `0₋` to `0₊`;
* a real point `x` is sent to `ℝ` iff `x ∉ (0₋, 0₊)` (the interval `(0₋, 0₊)` is sent onto the
  arc `K ⊆ ℍ`);
* two points of `ℍ̄` have the same image iff they are equal or are welded to each other by
  `weldingHom W T` (the two sides of the arc are glued by the welding homeomorphism
  `[0₋, 0] → [0, 0₊]`, the tip being the image of `0`). -/

/-- **Carathéodory extension for the complement of a simple arc** (applied to the reverse Loewner
map). If the reverse hull `revHull W T` is a simple curve from a real point, then `revMap W T`,
a conformal map of `ℍ` onto the Jordan-type domain `ℍ \ K` whose boundary is locally connected,
extends continuously to `ℍ̄`, and the extension has the two-sided boundary correspondence onto
the arc described in `IsCaratheodoryRevExt`.
