/-- **Regularity of the boundary measure of the reverse coupling** (blueprint level, M4).
In the setting of Theorems 1.3/1.4 (`κ ∈ (0,4)`, `T > 0`, `B` a Brownian motion, `X` an
independent free-boundary GFF modulo constants, `h = 𝔥_T + X∘f_T` = `couplingFieldRev`),
almost surely the `√κ`-LQG boundary measure `ν_h` on `ℝ`
* has no atoms,
* charges every nondegenerate open interval, and
* is finite on every compact interval.

These are exactly the properties that make `weldR` (defined by an infimum) the point `R(s)` with
`ν[s,0] = ν[0,R(s)]`, as used in Sheffield's proof of Theorem 1.4.

Justification (corrected per AUDIT3 M4, 2026-09-27). Duplantier–Sheffield (2011) §6 does **not**
apply on `(0₋,0₊)`: there `f_T` maps the interval onto the SLE curve, so `log|f_T'|` has no boundary
values and `X∘f_T` is not a free GFF near the interval (its kernel couples `x` with its welded
partner). The item is instead provable in-project: semicircle raw values are genuine pairings a.s.
(RC1), they are limits in probability of pairings with a fixed mollifier sequence (TREG), Theorem 1.2
transfers the law of the normalized `coordsFull` from `ofFun 𝔥₀ + X'`, and the M4 results (B3, P2,
P5, T6(a)) conclude. **Proved**: `RevCouplingReg.revCouplingBoundaryMeasureRegular`
(`Proofs/LQG/RevCouplingReg.lean:116`, entry L-RCBMR; standard axioms). -/
