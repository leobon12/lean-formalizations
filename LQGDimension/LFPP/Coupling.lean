# Node `C36` (`Draft.CouplingAtPoints`): the coupling (3.6) at finitely many points

We prove `Blueprint.Draft.CouplingAtPoints` with the constant `C_ρ = Cb ρ`.

Strategy (deterministic Hilbert-space computation plus Gram gluing, all in finite dimensions).

1. **Joint kernel** (`CouplingAux3`).  On indices `(s, false)` (band field `G_{ε,ρ}(s)`) and
   `(s, true)` (circle average `h_ε(s)`) the kernel `Kc ε ρ i j = ∫_0^∞ P_t(i,j) dt/t` pairs, at
   each scale `t`, the signed measures `1_{(ε,ρ]}(t) δ_s` and `σ_{s,ε} - σ_{0,1}` against the
   Gaussian kernel `e^{-|x-y|²/(4t²)}`.  Writing that kernel as a Fourier integral against the
   standard Gaussian on `ℂ ≅ ℝ²` makes `Kc` positive semidefinite (`Kc_psd`).  Its band block
   is `bandCov` (`Kc_ff`), and by the heat-kernel (Frullani) representation of `-log` together
   with the circle averages `⨍ log|x - ·| = log max(r, |x - c|)` its circle block is
   `gffCircleCov` (`Kc_tt`).
2. **Uniform bound** (`Kc_diag_bound`).  `‖k_s - b_s‖² = ∫_0^∞ Q_t dt/t` with `Q_t` bounded
   on `(0, ε]` by the circle self-pairings (controlled by the heat representation of
   `log ε`), on `(ε, ρ]` by `ε²/t² +` a unit-circle term, and on `(ρ, ∞)` by `C_ρ/t²`
   (zero mass).
3. **Gluing** (`CouplingAux4.glue`).  Realise `Kc` by Gram vectors (`exists_gram_of_psdOn`), and
   transport the given band realisation `w` onto the band vectors by a linear isometry of an
   ambient Euclidean space (`LinearIsometry.extend`).
