# Blueprint: existence of the GFF circle-average process (non-vacuity)

`GFFCircleAverageExists` says the hypothesis `IsGFFCircleAverage` of Theorem 1.1 is
satisfiable.  Without it, (1.5) and (1.6) would hold vacuously.  This track does not affect
the proof of Theorem 1.1; it removes the non-vacuity caveat of `STATEMENT_SPEC.md`.

Planned route:

1. A countable dense set `T₀ ⊆ (0,∞) × ℂ` of radii and centres.
2. The kernel `gffCircleCov` is PSD on finite subsets of `(0,∞) × ℂ`, radii included
   (`GffCovPSD`).  So it has a Gram representation by finitely supported sequences on `T₀`
   (`CountableGramRep`), and `X_t(ω) = Σ_k v_t(k) ω_k` with i.i.d. standard Gaussians `ω_k` is
   a centered Gaussian family on `T₀` with covariance `gffCircleCov`.
3. The kernel is continuous and has Hölder-½ increments on compact boxes
   (`GffCovContinuous`, `GffIncrementBound`).  Hence `X` is almost surely locally uniformly
   continuous on `T₀` (`GaussianSeriesLocallyUnifCont`) and extends continuously to
   `(0,∞) × ℂ`.
4. The finite-dimensional laws of the extension are Gaussian limits with covariance
   `gffCircleCov`.  This is the assembly node.
