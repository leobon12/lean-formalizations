# Theorem A: the actual mathematical target

This is a proposition to be proved, not a theorem certificate. It states the
paper's random-walk convergence result with the approved ambient-collar repair
`closure U ⊆ interior D`. All measures below are tied to the processes through
their defining laws. There are no free error sequences or assumed convergence
transfers. See `STATEMENT_SPEC.md` for the explicitly approved corrections.

/-- Bou-Rabee--Gwynne Theorem A, with the approved statement repairs.

For orthogonal tilings satisfying (1.3) and one of the geometric alternatives
I/II/III, the actual stopped polygonal conductance-walk laws converge to the
actual stopped standard Brownian laws in the Fréchet curve metric, uniformly
over all starting points in `U`. The conclusion also asserts existence of the
Brownian law, the eventually defined walk laws, finite exit and measurability.

The nearest-vertex selection may be any minimizer; this includes the paper's
lexicographic convention. The discrete curve runs through the first exit vertex
and is constant when its chosen initial vertex is already outside `U`.
