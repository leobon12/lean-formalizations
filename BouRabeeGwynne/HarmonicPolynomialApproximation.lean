# Genuine harmonic approximants for the Section 4 harmonic-measure argument

Polynomial density on a sphere and the finite-dimensional polynomial Dirichlet
construction give globally harmonic polynomial approximants. Since they are
harmonic on every enlarged ball already, no parameter-dependent Poisson
extension theorem is needed. Continuity controls the small overshoot of the
discrete exit points off the sphere.
