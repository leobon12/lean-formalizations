# Completing a finite matched coupling by an actual product measure

A partial coupling with dominated marginals is completed using the product of
its two residual marginals, normalized by their common mass. This includes the
zero-residual case. It is the explicit coupling construction for finite spatial
partitions in the Section 4 skeleton argument.
